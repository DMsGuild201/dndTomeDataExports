Only when all its effects are gone is this spell dispelled.\n \n• Difficult Terrain. You can fill any number of 5-foot squares on the ground with difficult terrain.

You can call forth up to eight servants from the Alrisen whose token you’ve used to cast the spell. These servants are the potential familiars listed for warlocks who’ve chosen the Pact of the Chain feature, or other creatures with a CR of 1 or lower.

You can decide on a trap that will cause the spell to be cast, triggering when a creature takes an action that you specify when you create the lair, such as touching a certain object or speaking a certain phrase.

	"text":"When you cast this spell, you place the sharpened metal on the ground and transform it into a frostbound bear trap that occupies a 5-foot square. This trap is nearly invisible, and requires a successful Wisdom (Perception) check to detect it and a successful Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to disarm it. The DC for these checks is equal to your spell save DC.\n The first time a creature enters the area occupied by this trap, it triggers, it reveals itself, and clamps shut. The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. If they fail, they take 2d10 piercing damage and 1d10 cold damage, and have their movement speed reduced to 0 while they are trapped.\n A creature caught in the trap can be freed by using an action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. If successful, the creature is freed from the trap. Once a creature is freed from the trap, or the trap is disarmed, the spell ends and the trap vanishes.\n At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the piercing or cold damage (your choice) increases by 1d10 per slot level above 2nd."
