The area by default is a 50-foot square, but its dimensions may be whatever you wish, provided it is one continuous pool and the total surface area does not exceed 2500 square feet. The resulting pool has a depth of 10 feet and is difficult terrain. The area looks like a shallow pool of water at first glance, and any creature that was not aware of the spell being cast must make an Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell DC to believe otherwise before contact is made with the pool. A creature entering the pool for the first time on a turn or starting its turn there must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 acid damage on a failed save and sinking into the pool, as the grappled condition. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much acid damage and is not grappled. A grappled creature can use its action to make a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (its choice) against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself. A creature of size Large or smaller that fails the saving throw while already grappled by the pool is also restrained against your spell save DC. A restrained creature can't breathe, and any nonmagical metal objects it carries begin to corrode. When the restrained creature takes acid damage from the pool, non-magical metal weapons and armor take a permanent, cumulative -1 penalty to their damage rolls and AC, respectively. If this penalty on a weapon reaches -5, the weapon is destroyed; similarly, armor is destroyed if its AC is reduced to 10. Other metal objects take cumulative damage as well, as the pool eats through a 1-inchthickness of non-magical metal each round it is immersed.\r\n",

      "text": "A 10-foot-radius invisible sphere of antimagic surrounds you. This area is divorced from the magical energy that suffuses the multiverse. Within the sphere, spells can't be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and even magic items become mundane. Until the spell ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you.\n   Spells and other magical effects, except those created by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere and can't protrude into it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed spell is consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn't function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration.\n   54-72: Spells and other magical effects, such as magic missile and charm person, that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that target.\n   41-65: The area of another spell or magical effect, such as fireball, can't extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For example, the flames created by a wall of fire are suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough.\n   53-65: Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.\n   4d-67: The properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a +1 long sword in the sphere functions as a nonmagical long sword. A magic weapon's properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a magic weapon or piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere (For example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.\n   4d-67: Teleportation and planar travel fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such magical travel. A portal to another location, world, or plane of existence, as well as an opening to an extradimensional space such as that created by the rope trick spells, temporarily closes while in the sphere.\n   43-65: A creature or object summoned or created by magic temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer within the sphere.\n   44-73: Spells and magical effects such as dispel magic have no effect on the sphere. Likewise, the spheres created by different antimagic field spells don't nullify each other.",

Choose antipathy or sympathy as the aura's effect.\n   41-74: The enchantment causes creatures of the kind you designated to feel an intense urge to leave the area and avoid the target. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened. The creature remains frightened while it can see the target or is within 60 feet of it. While frightened by the target, the creature must use its movement to move to the nearest safe spot from which it can't see the target. If the creature moves more than 60 feet from the target and can't see it, the creature is no longer frightened, but the creature becomes frightened again if it regains sight of the target or moves within 60 feet of it.\n   53-6d: The enchantment causes the specified creatures to feel an intense urge to approach the target while within 60 feet of it or able to see it. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or use its movement on each of its turns to enter the area or move within reach of the target. When the creature has done so, it can't willingly move away from the target. If the target damages or otherwise harms an affected creature, the affected creature can make a Wisdom saving throw to end the effect, as described below.\n   45-64: If an affected creature ends its turn while not within 60 feet of the target or able to see it, the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw. ON a successful save, the creature is no longer affected by the target and recognizes the feeling of repugnance or attraction as magical. In addition, a creature affected by the spells is allowed another Wisdom saving throw every 24 hours while the spell persists.\n   A creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to it for 1 minute, after which time it can be affected again.",

The target's perception of the vessel may vary and is chosen by the caster as they form a mental image of the target's place of voluntary imprisonment. The target will be able to verbally communicate with creatures outside of the vessel, and to communicate telepathically with creatures attuned to the item. While within the vessel, the target may summon any mundane items they desire. The item used as a vessel gains a magical aura about it and is inured to wear and damage. It also has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects, and resistant to damage originating from such. The item uses the statistics of the bound creature for saving throws, and the maximum value of the bound creature's Hit Dice (including its Constitution modifier) for determining the item's HP. Its AC is 25, and any damage to it is repaired at a rate of 5 HP per round. Ending the Spell: The spell may be ended through a ceremonial ritual where diamonds worth at least 500gp per Hit Die of the bound target are fired in a brazier for 24 hours, stoked and fueled with rare herbs native to the target's place of birth. The item must be laid upon the diamonds for the duration of the ceremony, and the true name of the target chanted at its zenith. Performing this ritual will expunge the target's soul from the item, releasing it to its expected destination upon death, and destroying the possessed item along with all resources used in the ritual. A Dispel Magic spell can end the spell only if it is cast as a Level: 9 spell, targeting the item.\r\n",

During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.\n   As an action, you can temporarily dismiss your familiar. It disappears into a pocket dimension where it awaits you summons. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. As an action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in any unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.\n   You can't have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell while you already have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new form. Choose one of the forms from the above list. Your familiar transforms into the chosen creature.\n   Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the spell as if it had cast the spell. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the spell when you cast it. If the spell requires an attack roll, you use your attack modifier for the roll.",

For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.\n   You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.\n   When you inscribe the glyph, choose explosive runes or a spell glyph.\n   45-70: When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the glyph. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the aura must make a Dexterity saving throw.

The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.\n   41-20: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of an explosive runes glyph increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd. If you create a spell glyph, you can store any spell of up to the same level as the slot you use for the glyph of warding.",

The area is 120 feet on each side, and it must not have any buildings or other structures on it. Any creatures in the area are harmlessly lifted up as the fortress rises.\n   The fortress has four turrets with square bases, each one 20 feet on a side and 30 feet tall, with one turret on each corner. The turrets are connected to each other by stone walls that are each 80 feet long, creating an enclosed area. Each wall is 1 foot thick and is composed of panels that are 10 feet wide and 20 feet tall. Each panel is contiguous with two other panels or one other panel and a turret. You can place up to four stone doors in the fortress's outer wall.\n   A small keep stands inside the enclosed area. The keep has a square base that is 50 feet on each side, and it has three floors with 10-foot-high ceilings. Each of the floors can be divided into as many rooms as you like, provided each room is at least 5 feet on each side. The floors of the keep are connected by stone staircases, its walls are 6 inches thick, and interior rooms can have stone doors or open archways as you choose. The keep is furnished and decorated however you like, and it contains sufficient food to serve a nine-course banquet for up to 100 people each day. Furnishings, food, and other objects created by this spell crumble to dust if removed from the fortress.\n   A staff of one hundred invisible servants obeys any command given to them by creatures you designate when you cast the spell.

Reducing a section of stone to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected sections to buckle and collapse at the DM's discretion.\n   After 7 days or when you cast this spell somewhere else, the fortress harmlessly crumbles and sinks back into the ground, leaving any creatures that were inside it safely on the ground.\n   Casting this spell on the same spot once every 7 days for a year makes the fortress permanent.",

You and any creature you designate when you cast the spell can enter the extradimensional dwelling as long as the portal remains open. You can open or close the portal if you are within 30 feet of it. While closed, the portal is invisible.\n   Beyond the portal is a magnificent foyer with numerous chambers beyond. The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm.\n   You can create any floor plan you like, but the space can't exceed 50 cubes, each cube being 10 feet on each side. The place is furnished and decorated as you choose. It contains sufficient food to serve a nine course banquet for up to 100 people. A staff of 100 near-transparent servants attends all who enter. You decide the visual appearance of these servants and their attire. They are completely obedient to your orders. Each servant can perform any task a normal human servant could perform, but they can't attack or take any action that would directly harm another creature. Thus the servants can fetch things, clean, mend, fold clothes, light fires, serve food, pour wine, and so on. The servants can go anywhere in the mansion but can't leave it. Furnishings and other objects created by this spell dissipate into smoke if removed from the mansion. When the spell ends, any creatures inside the extradimensional space are expelled into the open spaces nearest to the entrance.",

If you can cast this spell in the same area every day for a year, the spell lasts until dispelled.\n The spell creates the following effects within the area. When you cast this spell, you can specify creatures as friends who are immune to the effects. Creatures that have been marked by the Alrisen whose token you have used are also immune to the effects, as are creatures who you choose to allow at the time of their entry.\n The entire lair pulses with eldritch power. Dispel magic cast on the area removes only one of the following effects if it succeeds, not the entire area. That spell’s caster chooses which effect to end. Only when all its effects are gone is this spell dispelled.\n \n• Difficult Terrain. You can fill any number of 5-foot squares on the ground with difficult terrain. This terrain appears in a manner fitting for the Alrisen, such as the grasping hands of the dead, eerie tentacles, burning stakes of wood, or semisolid bars of radiant light. The obstacles move aside for and close behind creatures that are immune to this effect. \n• Otherworldly Inscriptions. You can fill any number of 5-foot squares on the ground that aren’t filled with difficult terrain with murals, runes, scratchings, etchings, or other sigils. A creature that steps on a sigil takes 1d6 damage of a type fitting to the Alrisen patron, as the defensive magic unleashes scorching fire, chilling ocean water, radiant energy, or the cruel necrotic power of the grave. To a creature immune to this effect, the inscriptions whisper in eerie voices or recount the stories of heroes from distant worlds. \n• Eldritch Servants. You can call forth up to eight servants from the Alrisen whose token you’ve used to cast the spell. These servants are the potential familiars listed for warlocks who’ve chosen the Pact of the Chain feature, or other creatures with a CR of 1 or lower. If any creature not immune to this effect enters the warded area, the eldritch servants fight until they have drive off or slain the intruders. The servants also obey your spoken commands (no action required by you) that you issue while in the area. If you don’t give them commands and no intruders are present, the servants do nothing other than patrol and dwell within the lair. The servants can’t leave the otherworldly lair. When the spell ends, they disappear. \n• Deadly Trap. Choose one spell that you can cast with a duration of “Instantaneous” that deals damage and has a casting time of one action or bonus action. You can decide on a trap that will cause the spell to be cast, triggering when a creature takes an action that you specify when you create the lair, such as touching a certain object or speaking a certain phrase. Once the trap triggers, it cannot do so again until at least one hour has passed.",

That entity sends a celestial, an elemental, or a fiend loyal to it to aid you, making the creature appear in an unoccupied space within range. If you know a specific creature's name, you can speak that name when you cast this spell to request that creature, though you might get a different creature anyway (DM's choice).\n   When the creature appears, it is under no compulsion to behave in any particular way. You can ask the creature to perform a service in exchange for payment, but it isn't obliged to do so. The requested task could range from simple (fly us across the chasm, or help us fight a battle) to complex (spy on our enemies, or protect us during our foray into the dungeon). You must be able to communicate with the creature to bargain for its services.\n   Payment can take a variety of forms. A celestial might require a sizable donation of gold or magic items to an allied temple, while a fiend might demand a living sacrifice or a gift of treasure. Some creatures might exchange their service for a quest undertaken by you.\n   As a rule of thumb, a task that can be measured in minutes requires a payment worth 100 gp per minute. A task measured in hours requires 1,000 gp per hour. And a task measured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10,000 gp per day. The DM can adjust these payments based on the circumstances under which you cast the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature's ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived. Nonhazardous tasks typically require only half the suggested payment, while especially dangerous tasks might require a greater gift. Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal.\n   After the creature completes the task, or when the agreed-upon duration of service expires, the creature returns to its home plane after reporting back to you, if appropriate to the task and if possible. If you are unable to agree on a price for the creature's service, the creature immediately returns to its home plane.\n   A creature enlisted to join your group counts as a member of it, receiving a full share of experience points awarded.",

This spell doesn’t, however, remove magical diseases, curses, or similar effects; if these aren’t first removed prior to casting the spell, they take effect when the beast returns to life. This spell closes all mortal wounds, but it doesn’t restore missing body parts. If the creature is lacking body parts or organs integral for its survival—its head, for instance—the spell automatically fails.\\n",

If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place, if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.\n   The glyph is nearly invisible, requiring an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to find it.\n   You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, approaching within a certain distance of it, or manipulating the object that holds it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers are opening the object, approaching within a certain distance of it, or seeing or reading the glyph.\n   You can further refine the trigger so the spell is activated only under certain circumstances or according to a creature's physical characteristics (such as height or weight), or physical kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect hags or shapechangers). You can also specify creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.\n   When you inscribe the glyph, choose one of the options below for its effect. Once triggered, the glyph glows, filling a 60-foot-radius sphere with dim light for 10 minutes, after which time the spell ends. Each creature in the sphere when the glyph activates is targeted by its effect, as is a creature that enters the sphere for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.\n   44-61: Each target must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d10 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful save.\n   44-73: Each target must make a Constitution saving throw.

On a failed save, the target is overwhelmed with despair for 1 minute. During this time, it can't attack or target any creature with harmful abilities, spells, or other magical effects.\n   49-73: Each target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target is driven insane for 1 minute. An insane creature can't take actions, can't understand what other creatures say, can't read, and speaks only in gibberish. The DM controls its movement, which is erratic.\n   50-69: Each target must make a Constitution saving throw and becomes incapacitated with excruciating pain for 1 minute on a failed save.\n   53-65: Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and falls unconscious for 10 minutes on a failed save. A creature awakens if it takes damage or if someone uses an action to shake or slap it awake.\n   53-75: Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and becomes stunned for 1 minute on a failed save.",

Creatures and objects can pass through the wall, but if they do, their movement speed is halved until the start of their next turn. Ranged attacks that would pass through the wall automatically miss and damage the wall instead.\n The wall of ooze has AC 5, immunity to poison and acid damage, and has 120 hit points.\n When the wall appears, each creature within the area must make a Strength saving throw to break free from the thick slime, exiting into the nearest unoccupied space if they succeed. Creatures that fail, or creatures that end their turn within the wall, take 4d8 acid damage. Whenever a creature strikes the wall with a melee attack or passes through the wall for the first time during a turn, the creature takes 2d8 acid damage.\n At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the acid damage of each phase increases by 1d8 and the wall gains 20 additional maximum hit points per slot level above 5th.",

It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. Thus you can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.\n   If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to create crenellations, battlements, and so on.\n   The wall is an object made of stone that can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 15 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness. Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected panels to collapse at the DM's discretion.\n   If you maintain your concentration on this spell for its whole duration, the wall becomes permanent and can't be dispelled.

By simply speaking aloud, you can alter the very foundations of reality in accord with your desires.\n   The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of 8th level or lower. You don't need to meet any requirements in that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect. Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice.\n • You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn't a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.\n • You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in the greater restoration spell.\n • You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose.\n • You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to a lich's life drain attack.\n • You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish spell could undo an opponent's successful save, a foe's critical hit, or a friend's failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.\n\nYou might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the DM as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance, the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item's current owner.\n   The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn't 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast wish ever again if you suffer this stress.",
