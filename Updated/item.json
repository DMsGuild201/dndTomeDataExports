As a bonus action, you can expend one of its charges and slam the war pick into any flat, solid surface thats at least 5 feet across in any direction. When you do, you create a small rift in the the planar fabric of existence. If you expend a second charge in this way within one minute of expending the first, both rifts fully open and become a temporary portal between the two points. The rifts remain open until the end of your next turn or until you close them early at any time (no action required). Creatures and objects Medium and smaller can travel freely through the rifts while theyre open, carrying any momentum through to the other side. Both charges must be expended on the same plane of existence. If you dont use the second charge within one minute of the first, both the charge and rift are lost. When traveling through the portal, you reappear 5 feet in front of the rift you exit through in the direction you were facing.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can expend one of the weapons charges when you make an attack with it against a Medium or smaller target. If you hit, the target becomes the surface of one of your rifts and takes an extra 2d8 force damage from the attack. When there are two rifts open and at least one of them is on a target you attacked in this way, the attacked target or targets must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma saving throw or be immediately teleported to the location of the other open rift.

On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8 cold damage and its speed is reduced by half until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much cold damage and its speed is not reduced.\n\nAny surface within the blizzard is covered in a slick sheet of ice and sleet, turning the ground within the sphere into difficult terrain that remains for the blizzard's duration. While the blizzard persists, the area within the sphere is heavily obscured.",

    "description": "**Blood Pact Pendants**  \r\n*Wondrous item, very rare*\r\n\r\nThese iron pendants come in pairs and are connected by a powerful bond of self-sacrifice. In order to create this bond, you and a friendly creature perform a brief, 1 minute ritual to connect your destinies and forge a blood pact. When you create this blood pact, you must each agree on a number of hit points to permanently sacrifice, reducing your total maximum hit points (minimum 1). Once a pact has been forged, trickles of the bound creatures blood are absorbed into the normally clear gem adorning the face of this pendant. While the gem is filled in this way, it seems to gently swirl and pulse in time with your heartbeat.\r\n\r\nWhile each bound creature is wearing their pendant and are on the same plane of existence, theyre protected by this pact so long as one creature is still conscious. When a bound creature dies, theyre immediately revived with 2d10 hit points plus twice the number of hit points previously sacrificed by the creature. When a creature is revived in this way, the other bound creature immediately falls to 0 hit points and is knocked unconscious. This property ignores any effect that would normally prevent a creature from falling to 0 hit points. When this happens, both creatures maximum hit points are returned to normal. Once the pact is ended in this way, the gems and pendants crack and are no longer magical.\r\n\r\n&amp;#x200B;\r\n\r\n*With this ritual we bind,*\r\n\r\n*Commit our ichor intertwined.*\r\n\r\n*Should you cross through shadows door,*\r\n\r\n*Let my body hit the floor.*\r\n\r\n*I will fall so you can rise,*\r\n\r\n*And put an end to your demise.* \r\n\r\n&amp;#x200B;\r\n\r\n**$7 patrons voted to make this item!** Every week, [$7 patrons](https://www.patreon.com/the_griffons_saddlebag) can suggest and vote on new item themes and mechanics to make!

Its handle is covered in small holes that drink in whatever blood runs off the blade. While there is a small reservoir for blood at the daggers pommel, it never fills completely. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls you make with this magic weapon.\r\n\r\nThe dagger has 5 charges and regains 1d3+2 expended charges each day at dusk. You can expend 1 charge as an action to make a melee spell attack using your spell attack bonus against a living creature you can see within 5 feet of you using the dagger. When you do, the dagger begins to blur and leave behind a crimson afterimage as you attempt to plunge the blade into the flesh of the creature. A creature hit by the attack takes necrotic damage equal to 3d4 + your spellcasting ability modifier, and you regain hit points equal to the damage dealt. If the target of the attack is a construct, plant, or undead creature, you dont regain any health in this way.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can expend 1 or more of the daggers charges when you cast a 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level spell. The spell must target either a single creature or yourself. For each charge you expend in this way, you also sacrifice 1 Hit Die. Roll a number of Hit Dice equal to the number of expended charges and take necrotic damage equal to the total number you roll. This damage ignores resistance and immunity. For each expended charge, the spell you cast counts as if it were cast with a slot one level higher than it actually was. You cant increase the slot level of a spell in this way beyond 5th level. If expending a charge in this way causes you to fall to 0 hit points, the spell fails and you fall unconscious.\r\n\r\n&amp;#x200B;\r\n\r\n*Magic runs through each an every one of us. You have it.

The bowl holds up to 8 ounces of liquid. Once filled, the blood begins to slowly swirl on its own. If left to sit for 7 days without spilling, the blood in the bowl slows to a stop and pulses with a faint, internal glow.\n\nDrinking the still blood from the bowl causes you to regain hit points. Roll a d12. On a roll less than 12, you regain the number rolled + 4 hit points. The blood is thick and sweet, but leaves a bitter aftertaste.

Whatever drove them off was evil, for sure.*\n\n*Years have passed since I lived there. I did visit, though, maybe 50 years ago. It had changed. What was a lush wood was now a swamp of blood. The trees have grown to lift themselves out of the bog, and what few patches of ground there are to walk on are muddy with red.*\n\n*The people seemed to return, though.

A creature affected by this magic regains 2d10 hit points when its first affected by it, and while its connected to the tether, it deals an extra 1d10 damage of the weapons type to the first target it hits with a melee weapon attack on each of its turns.

As an action, a creature wearing the brooch can cast the *enlarge/reduce* spell on itself by turning the dial toward either the larger or smaller figure adorning the sides of the brooch. Once this ability has been used, it cant be used again until the following dawn.\r\n\r\nThe creature can choose to overload the brooch as a bonus action once the spell has been cast by forcibly twisting the dial beyond its normal limits. When it does, the creatures size changes by an additional category: growing either a second size larger if it had cast the *enlarge* spell or a second size smaller if it had cast the *reduce* spell before. The creatures size cant be larger than Huge or smaller than Tiny in this way. This second instance of the spell is considered to be a second spell in which the creature is concentrating on. For the remainder of the spells duration, the first time that the creature would fail a Constitution saving throw in order to maintain concentration on the spell, that creatures size is reverted to the size they were before overloading the belt. The next time that the creature fails a saving throw to maintain concentration in this way, it returns to its original size and the spell ends.\r\n\r\nWhen a creature returns to its original size after overloading the belt, it cant move or take actions until after its next turn.

The javelin effortlessly burrows through the ground (if able) to reach the target of the attack, stabbing through the ground to make the attack at its destination. After the attack, it burrows back to your location, jumping out of the ground and back into your hand. If you have no hand free, it falls to the ground at your feet. When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made in this way, the target of the attack takes an extra 1d6 bludgeoning plus 1d6 slashing damage as the weapon viciously erupts from the ground. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must also succeed on a DC 16 Strength or Dexterity saving throw (targets choice) or be knocked prone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Oh, I can do a lot with it.

When you move while wearing this cloak, small, tattered feathers drift from the cloak that vanish when they touch the ground. While wearing the cloak, your Constitution score increases by 2 to a maximum of 20, you are immune to disease and poison, and you have resistance to poison damage.\n\nIn addition, while wearing the cloak, you can speak its command word as a bonus action to cause it to transform into a pair of sickly vulture wings for 1 minute. While the cloak is transformed, you gain a a flying speed of 60 feet, and when you hit a creature below its hit point maximum with a melee weapon attack, that creature takes an extra 1d6 necrotic damage.\n\n***Curse.*** This cloak is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you until you are targeted by the *remove curse* spell. As long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling to part with the cloak, keeping it worn at all times. The cloak gives you an insatiable hunger for flesh, and while traditional food can sustain you, you no longer enjoy the smell or taste of it. While cursed, whenever you reduce a creature within 5 feet of you to 0 hit points, youre forced to make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, you are overcome with the urge to tear into the creatures flesh and feast: sacrificing any additional movement, action, or bonus action you had left on your turn. You can repeat this saving throw at the start of each of your following turns, ending your need to feast on a success.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Waste not, want more.* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**See imbalance?

The ice encasing a creature in this way has AC 12, 20 hit points, immunity to poison and psychic damage, and vulnerability to fire and thunder damage. Destroying the ice ends the effect early, releasing the slain creature inside and allowing it to fall prone.\r\n\r\n***Everglaciers Fury.*** As an action, you can plunge the pike into the ground at your feet. When you do, the blade of the pike magically vanishes into the earth and summons up to three icy spikes from the ground nearby. Choose up to 3 targets on the ground you can see within 15 feet of you. An affected target must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or take 3d8 cold damage as an frozen spike erupts from the ground beneath them. Immediately after using this property, the spikes recede into the ground, and the icy blade of the pike reappears.\r\n\r\n&amp;#x200B;\r\n\r\n*The Everglacier doesnt take kindly to those that seek to destroy it.

When found, the circlet has 2 gemstones. A gemstone worth at least 10,000 gp can be added to the circlet over the course of 1 minute, where its magically drawn and fastened into place. While wearing the circlet, you can use an action to create a number of floating, magic swords equal to number of gemstones in the circlet to appear beside you. When you do, you can make one melee weapon attack with each of the floating swords against any target within 10 feet of you. You are proficient with these attacks, and you add your Intelligence modifier to the swords attack rolls, instead of Dexterity or Strength. On a hit, the target takes force damage equal to 2d6 + your Intelligence modifier. While the swords are summoned, you can use an action on your turn to repeat these attacks against any targets in range. The swords remain until you dismiss them as a bonus action and cast bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.\n\n*While the fighters held the blade, I was busying studying it.

Placing the beetle on a piece of parchment you hold or carry causes it to spring to life and begin mimicking your movements. As you move, so does the beetle. It leaves behind a small line of ink that it generates. The ink immediately dries and doesnt dissolve in water. In addition. the beetles small frame allows it to move even while enclosed in a book or similar enclosure without losing its sense of movement or direction.\r\n\r\nThe beetle has a dial on its underside. A creature can use the dial to select the scale in which the beetle moves. For each option, the beetle moves 1 inch in the same direction as you for every amount you move as shown on the dial, creating a map of your journey: 20 feet, 200 feet, 2 miles, or 20 miles. The beetle is immune to magical effects that would otherwise alter its sense of direction.\r\n\r\nThe beetle always knows which direction is North. When placed on a piece of parchment for the first time, it crouches down to stamp a small compass rose on the sheet before it beginning to move. If the beetle runs out of space on the parchment to travel, it stops moving in that direction and emits a clicking sound that can be heard by creatures within 5 feet of it.\r\n\r\nAttaching one *band of the found and lost* to the beetle while you wear the other allows the beetle to move in tandem with you even while uncarried.\r\n\r\n&amp;#x200B;\r\n\r\n*The Cartographers Guild of Antronec would hire small bands of adventurers to test their mettle on new and exciting expeditions provided they wear a single* band of the found and lost. *To make sure youre alright! they would say, with a smile.

Besides, the gold was always worth the request.*\r\n\r\n*In an enclosed room, well-guarded and hidden in the basement of the guild, the Cartographers would watch in earnest as these beetles would scurry across sheets of labeled parchment as bands of expendable mercenaries would plot the best—and worst—routes through the most dangerous places in the realm. Some maps were sold to the highest bidder. Others were used by Cartographers themselves to ransack the remains of their fallen hires and finish the job themselves.* \r\n\r\n&amp;#x200B;\r\n\r\n**See imbalance?

The brass dragon turtle head sculpture adorning its front magically creates and heats a small reservoir of water that replenishes each day at dawn. When you take fire damage, you can use your reaction to speak the shields command word to to superheat the water inside and halve the fire damage you take from the attack, effect, or spell that triggered it. The superheated water is released as dense cloud of steam centered on a point adjacent to you, heavily obscuring the area in a 15-foot radius sphere that spreads around corners. The cloud does not move with you and lasts for 1 minute or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.\r\n\r\nOnce this property of the shield has been used, its reservoir is emptied and cant be used again until the next dawn or its submerged in nonmagical salt water for at least 1 hour.\r\n\r\n&amp;#x200B;\r\n\r\n*Fear the ocean.

The book can hold up to 50 pieces of paper and comes with 1d4 x 10 + 10 sheets already inside. You can write a recipe on one of the books pages. As you do, the paper becomes aromatic, smelling like the cuisine youre writing. You can eat the sheet of paper as an action and find that it has the taste, texture, and smell of the food described on its page. The sheet of paper takes the place of one meal.\r\n\r\nIf you add a more complex recipe to the book that takes at least 10 minutes to write — potentially using sensory language, descriptions of fine ingredients, or illustrations of the dish — eating the delicious sheet of paper provides enough nourishment to sustain a creature for one day. A creature that eats from the book using one of these complex recipes gains and has their hit point maximum increase by 15 hit points for the next 24 hours. In addition, if the creature is diseased or poisoned, it can reattempt the saving throw in order to resist it. A creature can only benefit from the book in this way once per day.  The book comes with 1d10 complex recipes already inscribed within.\r\n\r\nIn addition, you can use this book as an arcane focus when casting the *create food and water* spell should you know it. When you do, the food and drink you create can be aromatic and flavorful, recreating dishes from the book of your choice.\r\n\r\nWhen all the pages are removed from the book, roll a d20. On a 1, the tome bursts into fire and leaves the air in a 20 foot radius smelling like wine and fine cooking. The smell remains for 30 days. In addition upon rolling a 1, the books tattered remains transform into a bountiful meal, conjuring a *heroes feast* as if cast. The book is then destroyed. On any roll other than a 1, the book can be rebound using fine paper costing no less than 5 gp per page.\r\n\r\n&amp;#x200B;\r\n\r\n*This has to be the best flavor text youve ever written.

    "description": "**Eldritch Scarf**  \r\n*Wondrous item, rare*\r\n\r\nThis dark, silky scarf moves slightly on its own in a breeze that no one can feel. The scarf has an extradimensional space within the folds of its fabric that can only be reached while its worn. The space holds 40 pounds of material, not exceeding a volume of 4 cubic feet. The scarf always weighs 1 pound, regardless of its contents. Placing an object in the scarf follows the normal rules for interacting with objects. Despite being able to place an item in the scarf, reaching back into it fails to return it to your grasp.\r\n\r\nThe frayed ends of the scarf are actually wisp-like hands that slowly twist and curl on their own. While wearing the scarf, you can mentally command the eldritch hands as a bonus action to manipulate a simple object, such as open an unlocked door, stow or retrieve an item from the scarf or other open container, or pour the contents out of a vial. The hands cant attack, activate magic items, or carry more than 10 pounds. The hands hold onto any item retrieved from the scarf weighing no more than 10 pounds until taken from them (no action required). If the retrieved item weighs more than 10 pounds, the hands pull it from the scarf and drop it on the ground at your feet.\r\n\r\nA living creature cant be placed inside the scarf.\r\n\r\nPlacing the scarf inside an extradimensional space created by a bag of holding, portable hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and cant be reopened.\r\n\r\n&amp;#x200B;\r\n\r\n*Some people get excited when their clothes have pockets.

A *failed purity spear* is the rare version of a *purity spear*, a legendary weapon, that was made by a creature other than an elder fey. Its magic is a sad reminder that while unicorns are paragons of good, even their magic can become toxic when mistreated.\n\n***Corruption.*** This spear has 10 charges and regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dusk. You can expend 1 charge when you hit a creature with the spear to cause it to leech its corrupting fluid into the target. When you do, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 point of corruption. A creature takes 1d4 poison damage at the start of each of its turns for each point of corruption it has, up to a maximum of 3d4 poison damage. This poison damage ignores resistance and immunity. A creature with at least 1 point of corruption can make another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, it removes 1 point of corruption. A creature is poisoned while it has 3 or more points of corruption.\n\nIf you expend the spears last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the tip of the spear shatters, and the spear becomes a nonmagical quarterstaff.\n\n***Charge.*** If you move at least 20 feet straight toward a target and hit it with the spear on the same turn, the target takes an extra 1d8 piercing damage.\n\n***Curse.*** This spear is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you.

You also have disadvantage on attack rolls with weapons other than this one, unless no foe is within 60 feet of you that you can see or hear.

The first time that a creature moves through or starts their turn in a space that has a mushroom in it, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw equal to your spell save DC or take 2d6 poison damage. The mushrooms live for 1 minute or until they fall to 0 hit points.\r\n\r\nThe staff also has 15 charges and regains 2d6+3 expended charges each day at dusk. While holding the staff, you can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from the it, using your spell save DC: *cloudkill* (5 charges), *fog cloud* (1 charge), *insect plague* (5 charges), or *stinking cloud* (3 charges). You cast these spells using a bonus action instead of their normal casting time and must target a point adjacent to a space occupied by one of the mushrooms. In addition, the spells durations are 1 round instead of their normal duration, ending at the end of your next turn, and do not require concentration to cast.\r\n\r\nIf you expend the last charge from the staff, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff begins to violently overgrow, forcing you to drop it in an unoccupied space adjacent to you. If the staff is dropped on solid ground, a *violet fungus* (*Monster Manual* p. 138) grows in its place.\r\n\r\n&amp;#x200B;\r\n\r\n*The festerwoods deep moss hides its ravenous flora.

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit a creature concentrating on a spell with this weapon, runes start to glow on the weapons head, and that creature makes the resulting Constitution saving throw to maintain its concentration with disadvantage.\n\nAs an action, you can speak the weapons command word and hold it aloft, causing the metal book adorning the head of the maul to wildly turn its pages and shatter. When it does, any spell or magical effect within 60 feet of you is dispelled, as if affected by the *dispel magic* spell (5th-level version). A spell or magical effect cast using a 6th-level spell slot of higher is unaffected in this way.

While some believe that her ferocity and heroism were a result of phoenix blood running through her veins, others claim that a hero will always rise from the ashes when the time is right.\r\n\r\nA spark of this heroism resides within the helmet, imparting its passion and phoenix-like properties to you. You have resistance to fire damage while wearing the helmet. While youre in combat, magical flames spew from the helmet while you wear it. The fire is harmless and casts bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.\r\n\r\n***Fiery Spirit.*** While wearing the helmet, you and friendly creatures standing within its bright light have advantage on saving throws to resist becoming charmed or frightened. In addition, you and friendly creatures within the bright light regain consciousness on a roll of 19 or 20 on death saving throws.\r\n\r\n***Ignite.*** While wearing the helmet, you can cast the *fire shield* spell to create a warm shield as a bonus action, requiring only verbal components. When you do, you also sprout a pair of flaming wings that last for the duration of the spell and give you a flying speed of 30 feet. Once this property has been used, it cant be used again until the next dawn.\r\n\r\n***Call of the Phoenix.*** This helm has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 daily at dawn. While wearing the helmet, you can expend 1 or more charges from it to cast the following spells, requiring only verbal components to do so (save DC 18): *death ward* (3 charges), *flame strike* (4 charges), or *healing word* (2nd-level version, 1 charge; +5 spellcasting ability modifier).\r\n\r\n***From the Ashes.*** If you are reduced to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to call upon the spark of heroism that resides within the helmet. You are instead reduced to 10 hit points, and each creature within 10 feet of you is forced to make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d10 fire damage, or half as much damage on a successful one. In addition, two flaming wings unfurl from your back and carry you to an unoccupied space up to 60 feet away from you without provoking opportunity attacks. Once this property of the helm has been used, it cant be used again until 2 days have passed. If you die while attuned to this helmet, it vanishes in a cloud of embers and smoke and reappears somewhere in the Elemental Plane of Fire.\r\n\r\n***Random Properties.*** The *Galea of the Soulfire Phoenix* has the following random properties:\r\n\r\n* 1 major beneficial property.\r\n* 2 minor detrimental properties. \r\n* 1 major detrimental property.\r\n\r\n***Destroying the Helmet.*** The only way to destroy the helmet is to feed it to an ancient phoenix. The phoenix dies and is immediately reborn as a result of the intense magic stored within the artifact. When its reborn, the phoenix has a pronounced crown of golden feathers upon its head. Regardless of how many times its reborn, the phoenix retains this crown of feathers.\r\n\r\n&amp;#x200B;\r\n\r\n*The soul of fire was never so brightly manifested in any as it was in Fara. Where she walked, her men had the fortitude and bravery of titans. Where she fought, her foes fell like reeds to a flame. She dealt and staved off death in equal measure, and none would ever be her equal in courage, vivacity, and daring. Long may her memory burn in our hearts and minds, for we are left here to carry on the torch she left for us.*\r\n\r\n&amp;#x200B;\r\n\r\n**See imbalance?

You can open the boxs wooden lid as an action. When you do, the red paste inside the box swirls and forms a toothy mouth that starts incessantly babbling nonsense. Every creature within 20 feet of the box that can hear it must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a creature cant take reactions until the start of its next turn and rolls a d8 to determine what it does during its turn. On a 1 to 4, the creature does nothing. On a 5 or 6, the creature takes no action or bonus action and uses all its movement to move in a randomly determined direction. On a 7 or 8, the creature makes a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach or does nothing if it cant make such an attack. A creature takes 1d6 piercing damage if it touches the red paste and toothy mouth while the box is opened and blathering in this way.\r\n\r\nThis effect lasts for 1 minute or until the boxs lid is closed again using an action. Once this property of the box has been used, it cant be used again until the following dusk.

    "description": "**Hrathi Soul Scepter**  \n*Rod, legendary (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*\n\nThis golden scepter has an empty basin at its end thats always hot to the touch, as if it had had been left out in the sun. While attuned to the rod, you can walk normally on difficult terrain caused by sand and can withstand temperatures as hot as 200 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nThe rod has 20 charges for the following properties. It regains 2d6 + 8 expended charges daily at dawn. If the rod is reduced to 0 charges, roll a d20. On a 1, the rod disappears in a burst of sand.\n\n***Sandblast.*** While holding the rod, you can use an action to expend 1 charge and send out a cascade of pressurized sand at a target you can see within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged attack roll using the scepter with an attack bonus of +10. On a hit, the sand deals 3d6 bludgeoning damage and disappears after the attack.\n\n***Sand Summon.*** While holding the rod, you can use an action to expend 3 charges to cause the ground in a 30-foot radius centered on a point you can see within 60 feet of you to turn to shifting sands for up to 1 minute. You can end the effect early as a bonus action. The area becomes sandy, difficult terrain for the duration.\n\n***Sandstorm.*** While holding the rod, you can use an action to expend 5 charges to cause a flurry of sand to whip up and swirl around you. The sand creates a blistering maelstrom that follows you in a 15-foot radius, 30-foot-high cylinder that lightly obscures the area. It remains so long as you concentrate (as if concentrating on a spell), to a maximum of 1 hour. Arrows, bolts, and other ordinary projectiles fly upward when they enter the area. Any creature that moves into the sandstorm for the first time on their turn or starts their turn there must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 2d10 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. You are immune to the effects of being within the sandstorm, and can see clearly through it. The sand disappears once the storm subsides.\n\nIf youre standing on sandy ground while concentrating on a sandstorm, you can use a bonus action to teleport to another unoccupied space you can see within 60 feet of you that is also on sandy ground.\n\n***Soul of the Hrathi.*** While holding the rod, you can use an action to expend 3 charges to summon a sand elemental in an unoccupied space on the ground that you can see within 30 feet of you thats covered in sand. Use the statistics for an earth elemental for this elemental, with the following changes:\n\n* The sand elemental can only move through areas of sandy terrain.\n* The sand elemental has advantage on any check it makes to grapple a creature.\n\nThe elemental remains so long as you concentrate (as if concentrating on a spell), up to a maximum of 1 hour, and disappears early if it drops to 0 hit points. It is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. Roll initiative for the elemental, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you dont issue any commands to the elemental, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*The Hrathi desert is home to some of the worlds most unforgiving land. Miles of sun-baked sand in any direction without a drop to drink. Unseen dangers underfoot over every dune. The nomads who live there subsist on meager rations and hardy livestock. The spirit of the desert is uncaring, and it yields to no one.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Did you miss the** [**Kickstarter**](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/thegriffonssaddlebag/more-magic-items-for-5e-the-griffons-saddlebag-book-one)**?** No sweat!

    "description": "**Heart of Damned Intervention**  \n*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a cleric or paladin)*\n\nThis large infernal heart was torn from a powerful archdemon and is 1 foot tall and weighs 10 pounds. It still pulses, softly, and spews out small gouts of flame from an unquenchable inferno within. The heart is hot to the touch and is wrapped by strange, writhing chains.\n\nThere is a glimmer of good in this heart that can be used to purify it. While attuned to the heart, you have resistance to fire damage, and you can cast the *hellish rebuke* spell as a 2nd-level spell at will.\n\n***Curse.*** This heart can only be purified and destroyed by a powerful celestial or deity, and attuning to it overwhelms your heart with its evil desires. The heart is cursed, and attuning to it extends the curse to you. Only a god or a *wish* spell cast by a good-aligned creature can end this curse. When you attune to the heart, the hearts flames turn pitch black as it painfully sears into your body, replacing your own heart, and severs your connection to the gods. You take 15d6 necrotic damage, leaving chain-shaped scars across your torso, and your alignment becomes evil if it wasnt already. While cursed, you and other creatures within 100 feet of you cant communicate with any god, and any radiant damage you deal becomes necrotic damage instead. In addition, you can understand and speak Abyssal and have disadvantage on attack rolls against demons and on saving throws against their spells and special abilities.\n\nIf you die while cursed in this way, your soul is bound to the lower planes and can only be restored to life by a *wish* spell or divine intervention.\n\nIn addition, while youre cursed, you can use an action speak a demons true name to summon it, causing it to appear in an unoccupied space you can see within 60 feet of you. The demon must have a challenge rating of 5 or lower. Roll initiative for the demon, which has its own turns. When you summon it and on each of your turns thereafter, you can tell the demon what to do on its next turn (no action required). If you dont issue a command, the demon spends its turn attacking any creature within reach thats attacked it. The demon disappears and returns to its plane of existence after 1 hour or when it reaches 0 hit points.\n\nWhile cursed, when you use your Channel Divinity, it becomes Channel Damnation instead:\n\n***Channel Damnation.*** As an action, you point your finger at a creature you can see within 120 feet of you and speak a powerful, damning curse. That creature and all creatures within 10 feet of it must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes fire damage equal to 1d12 + your cleric or paladin level and is bound by searing, hellish chains. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much fire damage and isnt bound by the chains. A bound creatures speed is halved and takes 1d12 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. At the end of each of its turns, the creature can make another Charisma saving throw. On a success, the effect ends on the creature.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*The heart yearns for more. It begs for forgiveness, for salvation, for deliverance. I am here to say that all hearts can carry good within them, but some are well beyond the point of redemption.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The books Kickstarter is live!** Get your copy of the books PDF for $20 or the physical book itself for $40 by backing the campaign!

The pendant has 8 + 1d4 charges when found. When a charge is expended, a pair of the pendants ribs magically rust.\n\nWhile wearing this pendant, you can use your reaction to expend 1 of the pendants charges when you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points, causing the target to immediately die before any magical effects or traits can either restore it to life or prevent it from falling to 0 hit points. When you do, you gain 2d6 temporary hit points, and that creature cannot be restored to life by any means other than by a *wish* spell or divine intervention. A creature is immune to this effect if it has legendary actions.\n\nWhen you expend the pendants last charge, the ribcage shatters and releases the ruby inside. When it does, the ruby crackles with necrotic energy and summons 12 skeletons that appear in unoccupied spaces that you can see within 60 feet of you. The summoned skeletons are friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the summoned creatures as a group, which have their own turns.

On a 5 or 6, you gain an additional use of your breath weapon before you need to finish a short or long rest.\n Terrible. Terrifying. Terrific.

Her wooden shield reformed itself to protect the now beastly form, becoming a wooden breastplate supported by verdant vines. With a final growl, her sprint turned into a rapid, lumbering gait as she began to run on all four legs.*\r\n\r\n*The battle was over before it began.

    "description": "**Lightning Pylons**  \r\n*Rod, rare*\r\n\r\nThese 3-foot long rods are made using a blend of magic and science and normally come in sets of 3. The pylons are tipped with a fragment of a blue dragons horn. Each pylon channels the latent electrical energy within these horn fragments and can extend that energy to neighboring pylons to create an electrical barrier between them. Each pylon has an electrical charge. Once that charge has been lost, It takes 12 hours for it to recharge.\r\n\r\nYou can set up a pylon in an unoccupied space adjacent to you as an action. While touching a set up pylon that has an electrical charge, you can speak its command word as a bonus action to electrify it. A pylon remains electrified for 1 minute and loses its electrical charge at the end of that minute. If there is at least 1 other pylon with a charge set up within 20 feet of an already electrified one, electricity jumps and arcs between them. A pylon becomes electrified once it receives electricity from a neighboring one in this way. You can have up to 6 pylons connected like this at once. Electrified pylons are magically bound to the ground until they lose their charge. \r\n\r\nThe electricity between the pylons forms a wall 10 feet high and 1 foot thick. The wall is opaque and casts bright light out to 10 feet and dim light for another 10 feet. When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 5d8 lightning damage and has its speed reduced to 0 until the start of its next turn. On a success, it takes half as much damage and has its speed halved instead. Creatures who are made of metal or are wearing metal armor have disadvantage on this saving throw. A creature that ends its turn within the wall or enters it for the first time on its turn must also make the saving throw. Setting up a pylon does not force you to make this saving throw.\r\n\r\nEach pylon has AC 15 and 20 hit points. A creature that touches an electrified pylon or hits it with a melee attack using a metal weapon takes 1d8 lightning damage for each pylon connected to it, including itself. Once a pylon is reduced to 0 hit points, it loses its electrical charge and ends the connection it may have to other neighboring pylons.\r\n\r\n&amp;#x200B;\r\n\r\n*He had been left alone for too long and given too many resources.

The gem contains magic absorbed from countless other sources that it uses to overpower the requirements of certain item attunements. While holding the gem against another item that requires attunement by a class or race other than you, you can attune to the new item nonetheless. The new item can be neither legendary nor an artifact. The gem fuses to the surface of the new item and encases the area around it in a crystalline shell.\r\n\r\nYou can unattune to the new item as normal, even if the item is cursed. Unattuning to cursed items in this way breaks the curses effects on you. When you unattune to the new item, the gem detaches from the item, allowing you to use it on another item. The crystalline shell remains on the unattuned item. The crystal absorbs any of the items magic when its removed in this way, causing the item to become mundane and nonmagical once you unattune to it.\r\n\r\n&amp;#x200B;\r\n\r\n*You* will *bend to my will.

    "description": "**Novanite Armor**  \n*Armor (any metal armor), very rare (requires attunement)*\n\nNovanite is a strong metal smelt from ore mined in the astral plane. Armor made from this metal absorbs more light than normal and gives off a strange, otherworldly aura. Glimmering cosmos can be seen in the armors reflections at night.\n\n***Astral Leap.*** While wearing this armor, you can speak its command word as an action to choose a space you can see within 30 feet of you. When you do, you vanish into a planar tear and reappear at the chosen spot at the start of your next turn, remaining in the Astral Plane until you do. If you would arrive in a place already occupied by an object or a creature, you take 3d6 force damage and appear in the nearest unoccupied space.\n\nDisappearing and reappearing in this way creates vacuums and waves as space is pushed and pulled around you. Any creature within 10 feet of the space you left or appear in must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d6 force damage and is pulled up to 10 feet toward the space you left from, or pushed 10 feet away from the space you reappear in. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much force damage and is not pulled or pushed.\n\nOnce this property has been used, it cant be used again until 12 hours have passed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*The metal was cold to the touch. It felt alien. Strange. Like it had seen more in its existence than anything I could possibly understand. It would persist long after my time, too, I was sure of it. Whatever heavenly journey it was on, I was merely a passing moment. To me, this metal was the difference between my today and my tomorrow.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Did you miss the** [**Kickstarter**](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/thegriffonssaddlebag/more-magic-items-for-5e-the-griffons-saddlebag-book-one)**?** No sweat!

    "description": "**Null Chalk**  \r\n*Wondrous item, very rare*\r\n\r\nThis slim leather pouch contains 1d4+1 sticks of dull grey chalk. The chalk feels slightly tingly to the touch.\r\n\r\nAs as an action, you can touch 1 of the sticks of chalk to a solid surface to magically create a line up to 50 feet long and 1 foot thick. You can shape the line in any way you choose so long as it makes one continuous path along the surface. Once a stick of chalk has been used in this way, it disintegrates into a pile of fine, nonmagical powder.\r\n\r\nMagical effects cant cross this line. The lines effects extend 20 feet up from where its drawn. Targets on the other side of the line are considered to have full cover for the purpose of targeting magical effects. Magical items that cross the line become mundane and nonmagical for 1 round.\r\n\r\nA celestial, elemental, fey, fiend, or undead creature cannot freely cross the line. It can make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw once on each of their turns in order to cross the line. On a failed save, a creature is repelled backward up to 10 feet away from the line and takes 2d8 force damage. On a successful save, it passes through the line and takes 1d8 force damage instead. If the line cuts through a creatures space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the line (your choice).\r\n\r\nThis effect lasts for 8 hours or until a break of at least one foot is made in the line, which causes it to instantly lose all magical properties. A creature can spend 1 minute to smudge, smear, erase, or otherwise remove the line enough to disable its effects.\r\n\r\n&amp;#x200B;\r\n\r\n*Also good for upset stomachs. Well, maybe.

While holding this shield, you have a +1 bonus to AC. This bonus is in addition to the shields normal bonus to AC. In addition, while holding the shield, you have advantage on Constitution saving throws.\r\n\r\nThe center of the shield is ornamented with a durable, glassy lens that can project your holy radiance. You can use a bonus action while holding this shield to cause it to emit bright light from the lens in a 15 foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet. The light lasts until you use a bonus action to extinguish it or until you fall to 0 hit points.\r\n\r\n***Radiant Aura.*** When you doff this shield or by using an action, you can speak the shields command word and choose to throw it to a friendly creature or unoccupied space within 30 feet of you that you can see, causing the shield to radiate with your holy resolve and light. The shields light becomes suffused with divine intention, casting bright light in a 60-foot radius and dim light for an additional 60 feet instead of its normal radius. This holy light lasts for 1 minute, and any friendly creature within the bright light gains the effects of your paladin auras. Once this holy light fades, this property cant be used again until the next dawn.\r\n\r\n&amp;#x200B;\r\n\r\n*The Paladin stood tall. Proud.

While holding the quill, you can speak its command word as a bonus action to activate it. While activated, it magically floats upright and writes the words you speak to it on whatever stationary, nonliving surface its been placed on. When it reaches the edge of that surface, it begins a new line below before continuing. If the quill reaches the end of the surface, such as a piece of parchment, it taps against the surface expectantly until a new one is provided. You must be within 15 feet of the quill in order to speak to it. If the quill is behind total cover, it cannot understand you.

Strange, wispy smoke drifts around inside the orb, creating cloud-like shapes that are almost recognizable as real-life objects.\n\nWhile holding the orb, you can use an action to speak its command word, priming the orb and causing the smoke inside to restlessly billow and swirl. While holding the primed orb, you can gently squeeze it (no action required) to cause it to record that moment in time around you. When you do, the glassy sphere becomes perfectly clear over the course of 1 minute and reveals an exact duplicate of the area around you in up to a 30-foot radius as a miniature, illusory diorama inside it. While holding the orb, the scene inside soundlessly replays the next 6 seconds following the dioramas capture.\n\nAn orb remains primed for 1 minute or until used to capture a diorama. Touching a primed *orb of remembrance* to one that already has a diorama creates a duplicate of the diorama in the new orb. Speaking the command word again while shaking the orb causes the diorama inside to disappear into smoke, allowing it to be primed once more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Oscar was lost.

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. The crossbow has 4 charges and regains 1d3 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. You can expend 1 of the weapons charges when you make an attack with it to coat the fired bolt with a unique, self-generating venom. If the attack hits, the target takes an extra 1d6 poison damage and must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target is poisoned until the end of its next turn.\r\n\r\nIf you expend the crossbows last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the vessels attached to the crossbow shatter and spray poison in a 25-foot-radius sphere centered on your location. Creatures within the sphere take 1d12 poison damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. When this happens, the crossbow ceases to be magical and loses all of its additional properties.\r\n\r\n&amp;#x200B;\r\n\r\n*Orner Wreros was a man of many talents.

It was always worth the risk. Progress was never made without sacrifice.*\r\n\r\n*A green ichor dripped from the end of the crossbow bolt.*\r\n\r\n*Test number 15, he said to himself.

Well, I suppose thats a success. Pity about the audio enchantment, though. I was really hoping for more of a* pew *sound.*\r\n\r\n*He added some additional scribbles to the notes before walking away, removing his gloves as he left the room.

    "description": "**Pearl of Wisdom Quiver**  \r\n*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*\r\n\r\nThis magical quiver is made from the shell of an enormous oyster. Arrows that you pull from this quiver are considered magical, and are coated with a pearlescent, hydrophobic coating that allows you to fire easily through the water, negating any disadvantage imposed on them when used underwater. The arrows lose their magical finish when fired by another creature. In addition, you can reach into the quiver and speak its command word to magically produce a single pearl. You can hold onto this pearl or give it to another creature. When a creature holding the pearl makes an ability check that uses Wisdom or attempts a Wisdom saving throw, they can choose to use the pearl to gain advantage on the roll, causing the pearl to lose its luster and disintegrate. The pearl is visibly magical and disintegrates on its own after 24 hours if left unused. Once the quiver produces a pearl, it cannot produce another one until the following dawn.\r\n\r\n&amp;#x200B;\r\n\r\n*Nockin em back!*\r\n\r\n&amp;#x200B;\r\n\r\n**See imbalance?

    "description": "**Precipit, the Formless**  \r\n*Staff, artifact (requires attunement)*\r\n\r\nThis magic coral staff was first found within the Great Reef of the Elemental Plane of Water. Its origins beyond that are entirely unknown, with some suggesting it was made by the plane itself rather than forged or crafted by a mere creatures hands. Attuning to the staff bestows some of its planar powers to you, allowing you to breathe underwater and ignore any of the drawbacks caused by a deep, underwater environment. In addition, while holding the staff, you have resistance to cold damage.\r\n\r\nThis staff has 15 charges which are used to power its various properties. The staff regains 1d8 + 7 expended charges daily at dawn.\r\n\r\n***State Change.*** The staff has a powerful control over the various states of water. As a bonus action, you can mentally command the staffs ever-present bounty of water to change its state into a gas, liquid, or solid. The properties of each state are listed below. Alternatively, you can expend 1 charge as a reaction when you are the target of an attack or spell to force the staff to change its state more rapidly. When you do, the staffs change is immediate: potentially affecting the outcome of the incoming attack or spell. You take this reaction when you know you are the target of the attack or spell, but before knowing the result of the roll.\r\n\r\n***Gas.*** When the staff enters its gaseous state, the water surrounding the staff becomes a fine mist. While holding the staff in this state, you gain the following properties: • You are resistant to bludgeoning and piercing damage. • Your movement speed is increased by 10 feet. • You gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed. • You can pass through a hostile creatures space without reducing your movement speed. • Attacks of opportunity against you are made with disadvantage.\r\n\r\n***Gas Spells.*** While holding the staff in its gas state, you can expend 1 or more of the staffs charges on your turn to cast the following spells: *fly* (3 charges), *fog cloud* (1 charge), *gaseous form* (3 charges), *misty step* (2 charges), or *wind walk* (6 charges).\r\n\r\n***Tailwind.*** While holding the staff in its gas state, you can expend 2 charges and speak the staffs command word as an action to grant additional powers to you and nearby allies. You and creatures of your choice within 30 feet of you can take the Dash action as a bonus action on your next turn, and your movement doesnt provoke opportunity attacks until the start of your next turn.\r\n\r\n***Liquid.*** When the staff enters its liquid state, the water surrounding the staff becomes a swirling torrent. While holding the staff in this state, you gain the following properties: • You are resistant to bludgeoning and slashing damage. • Your movement speed is increased by 10 feet. • You gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed. • You can stand on and move across any liquid surface as if it were solid ground. • When a hostile creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to force that creature to repeat the same attack against another creature (other than itself) of your choice.\r\n\r\n***Liquid Spells.*** While holding the staff in its liquid state, you can expend 1 or more of the staffs charges on your turn to cast the following spells: *blur* (2 charges), *control water* (4 charges), *create or destroy water* (1 charge), *mirror image* (2 charges), or *water breathing* (3 charges).\r\n\r\n***Tide Turner.***  While holding the staff in its liquid state, you can expend 3 charges and speak the staffs command word as an action to send out a wave of ethereal magic water to buffet and push your enemies. Hostile creatures of your choice within 30 feet of you are forced to make a DC 18 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8 bludgeoning damage and is pushed either 20 feet toward your or away from you (your choice). On a successful save, the creature takes half as much bludgeoning damage and is not pushed.\r\n\r\n***Solid.*** When the staff enters its solid state, the water surrounding the staff becomes a frozen shell. While holding the staff in this state, you gain the following properties: • You are resistant to piercing and slashing damage. • Your movement speed is reduced to 5 feet. • You gain a +3 bonus to AC. • If youre pushed against your will, the distance you are pushed is halved. • You gain up to 10 temporary hit points at the start of each of your turns that last until the staff changes state.\r\n\r\n***Solid Spells.*** While holding the staff in its solid state, you can expend some of the staffs charges on your turn to cast the following spells (save DC 18): *cone of cold* (5 charges), *ice storm* (4 charges), *ray of frost* (no charges, or 1 charge to cast at 5th level; +10 to hit with ranged spell attack), *wall of ice* (6 charges).\r\n\r\n***Deep Freeze.***  While holding the staff in its solid state, you can expend 4 charges and speak the staffs command word as an action to send out a chilling blast to freeze your enemies. Hostile creatures of your choice within 30 feet of you area forced to make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8 cold damage and its speed is reduced to 0 until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much cold damage and its speed is halved instead.\r\n\r\n***Random Properties.*** *Precipit, the Formless* has the following random properties: • 2 minor beneficial property. • 2 minor detrimental properties.\r\n\r\n***Destroying the Staff.*** The only way to destroy the staff is to keep it untouched by water for one hundred years while on the Elemental Plane of Water, at which point it crumbles to dust. Any amount, such as a puff of misty air, a drip of water, or the touch of ice during that time reinvigorates the staffs bounty of water.\r\n\r\n&amp;#x200B;\r\n\r\n*The sea is a vessel for life, for time, and for change. How will you live in its watery embrace? Will you be swept up in its currents? And what kind of change is it that you seek to make? The choice is yours.*\r\n\r\n&amp;#x200B;\r\n\r\n**See imbalance?

Electricity magically courses through the weapon along specially channeled grooves in its hollow haft. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit with an attack using this halberd, the target takes an extra 1d4 lightning damage\n\nThis halberd has 10 charges and regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. While the weapon has at least 1 charge, you can use an action to load a crossbow bolt into its haft toward the bottom of the weapon. Powerful magnetic forces inside the hollow weapon stabilize the bolt and charge it with electricity. When you take the Attack action while holding this loaded weapon, you can expend 1 or more of its charges to make a special ranged attack with it by leveling and firing the halberd as if it were a crossbow. When you do, you dont make an attack roll for the attack, and the bolt is magically launched forward from the weapon in a 1-foot-wide line thats 10 feet long, plus an extra 10 feet for each charge you expend.

When the ring fits into place to complete the puzzle, the ring also casts the *circle of power* spell.\r\n\r\nThe spells cast by the ring do not require concentration and are only active while the aura emitted from the first band is active. Once the *aura of vitality* emitted from the ring fades, so do its other magics. Once the effect ends, you cannot activate the ring again until 1 day has passed for each band that you solved. If you solve all three bands to form the outer ring, you can attempt to reset the puzzle with a final DC 20 Intelligence check. On a success, the bands come apart and can used again immediately.

    "description": "**Quiver of Elemental Chaos**  \n*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)*\n\nThis quiver has a lid with 5 holes in it and has depictions of the Elemental Planes on its side. It has 4 buttons along its top that correspond to each of the four elements: Air, Earth, Fire, and Water.\n\n***Elemental Ammunition.*** The quiver can hold up to 5 arrows or bolts at a time, which appear through the holes in its lid. You can press one of the quivers buttons as a bonus action to cause it to produce up to 5 elemental arrows or bolts. The type of arrow or bolt depends on button you press. Excess ammunition is stored inside the quiver for use at a later time. The quiver can produce up to 5 of each type of ammunition in this way each day.\n\nAny arrow or bolt created by this quiver is magical and has the following properties based on its element. If its held by a creature other than you or it hits or misses a target, the ammunition is no longer magical.\n\n***Air Ammunition.*** This ammunition is weightless and whistles softly as it moves. This piece of ammunition can be fired at its long range without disadvantage and deals an extra 1d6 thunder damage to any target it hits. In addition, any atmospheric effect that the arrow passes through, such as a *fog cloud* or *stinking cloud*, is dispelled.\n\n***Earth Ammunition.*** This ammunition carries an uncanny force behind it and turns to stone at its end. When you hit with a ranged attack using this ammunition, the target takes an extra 2d6 bludgeoning damage and must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be pushed 10 feet away from you.\n\n***Fire Ammunition.*** This ammunition has tongues of fire licking up its side and spews embers at the slightest movement. When shot, it erupts into a plume of white-hot flame. This piece of ammunition deals an extra 1d6 fire damage to any target it hits. Hit or miss, the ammunition explodes. The target and each creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 fire damage.\n\n***Water Ammunition.*** This ammunition has a silky texture and glitters with watery reflections. A ranged attack made with this ammunition ignores the normal penalties of underwater fighting and deals an extra 2d6 piercing damage to any target it hits, or 3d6 piercing damage if the target is made of fire. In addition, any nonmagical flames within 10 feet of this ammunitions point of impact are extinguished when it hits.\n\n***Paraelemental Ammuntion.*** You can press two compatible elemental buttons at the same time as a bonus action to create a paraelemental arrow or bolt: a hybrid piece of ammunition. Water and Air create Ice, Fire and Earth create Magma, Earth and Water create Ooze, and Air and Fire create Smoke. This ammunition appears from a special compartment in the quivers lid. The quiver can create 1 of each type of paraelemental ammunition each day. A non-compatible combination, such as Fire and Water or Air and Earth, has no effect.\n\n***Ice Ammunition.*** This special piece of frosted ammunition is cold to the touch and casts off snowflakes when it moves. When you hit with a ranged attack using this ammunition, the target takes an extra 3d6 cold damage and must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target is paralyzed. On a success, the targets speed is halved until the end of its next turn. A creature with resistance or immunity to cold damage automatically succeeds on the saving throw. A paralyzed target can make another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, the effect ends. The effect ends early if the paralyzed target takes fire damage.\n\n***Magma Ammunition.*** This special piece of glimmering ammunition is warm to the touch and flakes off in sooty pieces. When you hit with a ranged attack using this ammunition, the target takes an extra 3d6 fire damage. Hit or miss, the area in a 20-foot sphere centered on the point of impact becomes unbearably hot until the end of the turn. Each creature within the area must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 level of Exhaustion from the sudden flash of heat. A creature with resistance or immunity to fire damage automatically succeeds on the saving throw.\n\n***Ooze Ammunition.*** This special piece of sticky ammunition gives off a faint, alchemical odor. This ammunition creates a unique *grease* spell (save DC 17) at the point of impact. This version of the spell covers a 20-foot square area, and any creature that starts its turn prone in the area takes 1d6 acid damage.\n\n***Smoke Ammunition.*** This special piece of black ammunition feels smooth like coal to the touch and releases a faint wisp of smoke that quickly dissipates. This ammunition creates the effects of a unique *fog cloud* spell (2nd-level version) at the point of impact. This version of the spell is pitch black and heavily obscures the area.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*The chaos that surrounds the Material Plane is just within reach. You just have to know what buttons to push.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Did you miss the** [**Kickstarter**](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/thegriffonssaddlebag/more-magic-items-for-5e-the-griffons-saddlebag-book-one)**?** No problem!

At its center is a gap that houses a single, perfect diamond thats magically suspended in place and glows with an uncanny energy. While grasping the hilt, you can use a bonus action to cause a wide blade of pure prismatic light to radiate from the axes head, or make the blade disappear. The axes blade emits bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet. \n\nYou gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which deals radiant damage instead of slashing damage. When you hit an aberration or undead with it, that target takes an extra 1d12 radiant damage.\n\nWhile the blade persists, you can use a bonus action to expand or reduce its radius of bright and dim light by 5 feet each, to a maximum of 30 feet each or a minimum of 10 feet each.\n\nThe light that comes from the diamond at the axes center and forms the blade can be wrought to create powerful, destructive glyphs. Over the course of 1 minute, you can trace a glyph onto the surface of the axe, starting with the gem at its center, to recreate the effects of the *symbol* spell with the following changes:\n\n* The glyph you create as part of the spell exists on the axe and moves with it.\n* The glyph can only triggered when you hit a creature with the axe.\n* The spell only affects the target that triggered the glyph.\n* Aberrations and undead have disadvantage on the saving throw to resist the spells effects.\n\nOnce this property of the axe has been used, it cant be used again until 12 hours have passed.

He was dressed in a plain gray robe with simple shoes. A single ring with three gemstones adorned his finger. There we go, that should do it, said the man. Thats one dead beasty. Glad I was here when it showed up!* \r\n\r\n*The farmer looked back and forth from the now smoldering monster to the plain man. He quickly reached into his pocket and held out a few coins with an old and shaky hand.* \r\n\r\n*Oh! Thats awful nice of you. Ill take some, but you probably need this more than I do, the robed man said. He reached carefully into the farmers hand to take a couple silver from the sad pile. As he did, the farmer took notice of the ring in greater detail. The three yellow gemstones were more like small, gelatinous eyes that swiveled around with small, slitted pupils. As if realizing this, the eyes turned to look at the farmer as well.* \r\n\r\n*Eeeyagh! shouted the farmer. His hand retracted and dropped the coins it had been holding. The robed man raised a curious eyebrow, casually holding the silver between two fingers.* \r\n\r\n*The robed mans expression turned from puzzled to a laugh. Oh! Ha, you met my ring. Yeah, theyre a piece of work. Dont mind them, theyre just nosy. Well, they would be, if they had one!* \r\n\r\n*He chuckled quietly as his own small joke and bent over to pick up the dropped coins. He handed them back to the farmer.*   \r\n*They hate getting poked, though. At least, thats what they told me, he said with a bright smile. I still poke em anyway, though. Keep em in check, you know? He winked.* \r\n\r\n*He deposited the coins in the farmers hand and got up. He dusted his robe and began to turn away.* \r\n\r\n*Wait! said the farmer, Whats your name, kind stranger?* \r\n\r\n*The man turned around and smiled, You can call me Irith.*\r\n\r\n&amp;#x200B;\r\n\r\n**See imbalance?

While wearing this ring, you can deal your extra Sneak Attack damage twice, instead of once, on each of your turns. The two attacks must be made against different targets, and the Sneak Attack damage for the second attack is halved.\r\n\r\nThe inside of the ring is blank when you first attune to the ring.

Motes of their spirit flow through the rod and allow you to channel some of their lingering power.\r\n\r\nThis rod has 5 charges and regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the rod and falling, you can use a reaction while falling or an action otherwise to expend 1 charge from the rod to cause two handles extend from either side of the rod. While holding the handles, a pair of magical wings appear above the rod that reduce your falling speed to 10 feet per round, or 20 feet if you weigh more than 200 pounds. While falling in this way, you gain a flying speed of 40 feet but cannot fly upwards without a significant updraft.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can use the rod to summon a buffeting gust of wind around you. While holding the rod, you can use an action  to hold the rod aloft and expend 1 charge. When you do, powerful winds rip around you and blow everything within 20 feet of you skyward in a column of wind 60 feet high. Creatures and objects weighing no more than 200 pounds must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be launched 30 feet upward before crashing back to the ground. You automatically succeed on the saving throw unless you decide to fail it. If you fail and use your reaction to summon the wings, youre carried upward 60 feet instead.\r\n\r\n&amp;#x200B;\r\n\r\n*They thought the old man was senile.*\r\n\r\n*He presented himself as a guide to the mountains, but these men wanted nothing but to trick him and poach for rumored roc eggs along the mountain.*\r\n\r\n*Is it true that these mountains are home to majestic rocs? Wed love the opportunity to study their natural habitat, they smiled. Smiles sickly sweet and fake, filled with malice. The old man simply smiled back. He walked with the help of a weird looking rod. Surely, it would be easy to ditch and outrun him later on.*\r\n\r\n*They reached the peak of the mountain, but they didnt find any rocs. Maybe the rocs werent home today, but it didnt matter. Touring through the mountain, the men had figured out the probable hiding spot of the eggs. Halfway down the mountain, three of the men went missing. Of course, it was a ruse. In the confusion, the men pretended to start panicking and running off in different directions.*\r\n\r\n*The men had regrouped and rushed into the nests hiding spot. They were surprised that instead of the nest, they found the old man waiting for them. He was keener than they thought, and they had walked right into his trap.*\r\n\r\n*The rocborne will not let you harm the little ones, the old man said, still smiling. A smile sickly sweet, but genuine. There was no malice in his smile.*\r\n\r\n*Suddenly, the men felt a strong rush of wind around them blowing them upward. They were helpless, completely under the mercy of this accursed mountain and its old caretaker. As quickly as it arrived, the winds dissipated, and they all fell to the ground with a loud collective thud. The last thing they saw was the old man, aloft, with his weird winged rod, before everything faded to black.*\r\n\r\n&amp;#x200B;\r\n\r\n**See imbalance?

    "description": "**Rope Caster**  \r\n*Weapon (crossbow, hand), common*\r\n\r\nThis magic weapon is a favorite among infiltrators. Its firing mechanism has no string, unlike other crossbows. Instead, this weapon can only be loaded with rope. When you load a length of rope into the crossbow, individual stands from the rope magically latch onto the weapons limbs and pull the mechanism taught. You can make a ranged attack with the crossbow to fire the rope at an object within range. If it hits, the object takes no damage from the attack but is bound by the rope. If the rope is long enough, it magically wraps around the target in a single loop and securely ties itself, leaving the remaining rope to hang from the knot. If the attack hits a creature, the rope falls harmlessly to the ground without being tied.\r\n\r\nIf you can reach the rope, you can retrieve up to 30 feet of it using an action. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, releasing a bound object within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the rope (AC 10) also frees the object without harming it, ending the effect and severing the rope.\r\n\r\n&amp;#x200B;\r\n\r\n*The halfling carried no bolts with him to load his crossbow; only a long stretch of rope hung loosely by his side. In a single, fluid motion, he drew the crossbow and placed the rope in its center, aiming it at the gargoyles on the roof of the dukes estate. A muted thunk, and the rope was launched 60 feet upward towards the stone structures along the roofs edge.

    "description": "**Seed of Rebirth**  \r\n*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)*\r\n\r\nThis fist-sized, magical seed can be attuned to by up to 4 creatures over the course of a long rest. Each creature attuned to the seed must participate in gently planting it in fertile soil. The seed immediately begins to flourish, growing into a majestic, flowering tree over the course of 7 days. The tree is 60 feet tall and 10 feet in diameter at its base, and its canopy extends out in a 30-foot radius from the center of the tree. The tree has a number of large limbs equal to the number of creatures attuned to the seed. Once planted in this way, no other creatures can attune to the seed, and a creatures attunement cant be broken early by any means other than a *wish* spell or committing a malicious affront to nature. The tree is magical and cant be destroyed by nonmagical means. Any creature attuned to the seed is magically alerted if the tree is being attacked or destroyed.\r\n\r\nWhen a creature attuned to the seed dies and remains dead for 1 minute, its soul returns to the tree and its body crumbles into a rich soil that recreates the *plant growth* spell, centered on the body. The soul returns to the tree regardless of circumstance, distance, or plane of existence of the creatures death. The returned soul is stored in a shelled nut that the tree grows at the time of the creatures death. After 1d6+1 days, the nut falls from the tree and breaks apart, revealing the reborn creature inside. The creature is reborn as if by the *reincarnate* spell. Once a creature is reborn in this way, its attunement to the seed is broken.\r\n\r\nWhen a creatures attunement to the seed is broken, the branch associated with that creature withers and dies. Once all of the trees branches wither in this way, the tree splits apart and disintegrates, releasing another *seed of rebirth* to the astral winds that carry it to a new location on a different plane of existence.\r\n\r\n&amp;#x200B;\r\n\r\n*Some of us die.

    "description": "**Shifters Shine**  \r\n*Potion, common or uncommon*\r\n\r\nThe typical *shifters shine*, a common potion, is a specialty alcoholic beverage that causes your face to appear more glamorous. For 1 hour after drinking this potion, your skins complexion clears, appears healthier, and grows more taut. Your face, while largely unchanged, is distinctly more attractive and exudes a weak aura of enchantment magic. When you make a Charisma check while under the effects of this potion, you can choose to forgo rolling the d20 to get a 10 on the die. Once you use this property, you cant use it again for the remainder of the potions duration. The potion is a rich honey color and swirls lazily around, regardless of how its handled. It can be found in any sort of vessel, though it is usually found in glass jars. The eye of a shapeshifter drifts along the potions bottom, making it a daunting beverage for the average taverngoer to order. It has an extremely strong alcoholic taste with a hint of caramel. Due to its magical nature, the alcohol within this potion affects a creature twice as much as the alcohol within a nonmagical beverage.\r\n\r\nThe following *shifters shine* is an uncommon variant with additional properties. It also tastes better.\r\n\r\nWhen you drink this potion, you gain the effects of the *alter self* spell for 1 hour (no concentration required) or until you end the effect as a bonus action.\r\n\r\n&amp;#x200B;\r\n\r\n*Everyone seems to get more attractive when you drink.

Each ring contains 2 charges and regains all expended charges each day at dawn.

When you do, you no longer have that spell prepared, and if the creature has the spell slots to cast it, it may cast the spell once as if it had the spell prepared. The tattoo fades from the creatures arm once it casts the spell within it or when you finish a long rest. You can only have 1 tattoo transferred in this way at a time.

If you die or are on another plane of existence than the seed for more than 1 day while it grows, the tree dies and the seed is destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe stem of the seeds cone is vaguely key-shaped.

It tapers gently inward towards the top of the tree. At the base of this magic tree is a door large enough for Medium creatures to enter. The door is guarded by a dryad who is loyal to you and any creature you choose. The dryad accepts the seeds stem as proof of ownership and uses it as a key to open the door. Once opened, your attunement to the seed ends and the tree belongs to you, and you and allies you designate to the dryad can enter and leave the tree at will. Your attunement to the seed can only be ended early by a *wish* spell. If it does, the key disintegrates and the door cannot be opened.\r\n\r\nInside the tree are 10 floors. You choose how to distribute the floors throughout the tree. A wooden spiral staircase climbs upward through the center of the tree and floors. Each floor has 10 small windows that cant be seen from outside the tree. In addition, the interior of the tree cant be the target of divination magic or entered by teleportation or by extradimensional or interplanar means.\r\n\r\nThe canopy of the tree extends 30 feet beyond the base of the tree. Soil beneath the trees canopy is exceptionally rich and fertile.\r\n\r\nThe tree has 500 hit points, immunity to damage from nonmagical weapons excluding siege weapons, and resistance to all other damage. The door has 100 hit points instead. If the tree is attacked, the tree rolls for initiative and creates a treant at its base to defend it at the start of its next turn (no action required) that acts on the trees initiative . Once a treant is created in this way, it cant be created again until the following dawn. Neither the treant nor the dryad can move farther than 1 mile from the tree. If the dryad is slain, it reappears the following dawn at the base of the tree. If you kill the dryad, the tree becomes a nonmagical tree that is still hollow inside with the floors youd chosen, but its windows are lost.\r\n\r\nThe tree creates another *spire seed* once every 100 years.\r\n\r\n&amp;#x200B;\r\n\r\n*Back in the old days, every family had a tree like this. Only when man emerged, and with their merciless greed for land and resources stood at the edges of our homes, did we have to give them up. Now the Spire Trees are few and far between, and protecting them, passing on their seeds only to the trustworthy, is our greatest responsibility.*  \r\n*- Archdruid Tiren Delduwa.*\r\n\r\n&amp;#x200B;\r\n\r\n**$7 patrons voted to make this item!** Every week, [$7 patrons](https://www.patreon.com/the_griffons_saddlebag) can suggest and vote on new item themes and mechanics to make!

The bladed end of the halberd looks like a hatchet thats been absorbed by the hewn wood. While holding the halberd with two hands, you can speak its command word as a bonus action to split the weapon into its more basic components. When you do, the halberd deconstructs in your hands, leaving you with a handaxe in one hand and quarterstaff in the other. Both the handaxe and quarterstaff have the light property. You can combine the two weapons to reform the halberd by speaking its command word again as a bonus action while youre holding both the handaxe and quarterstaff.\r\n\r\nYou gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

The creatures speed is reduced by 10 feet until the end of its next turn, and your speed is increased by 10 feet until the end of your turn.\r\n\r\n***Handaxe and Quarterstaff.*** If youre wielding the handaxe and quarterstaff in either hand, you gain a +1 bonus to AC and can add your ability modifier to the damage of your offhand attacks. The quarterstaff deals necrotic damage, and its damage die is maximized if it hits a nonmagical plant or plant creature. If you make a ranged attack with the handaxe, it flies back to your hand immediately after the attack.\r\n\r\n&amp;#x200B;\r\n\r\n*...It forms a kind of sick relationship, doesnt it? asked the wizard. His hand stopped glowing, the spell now complete. The wood that was cut by the axe wants to remain tied to it. One likes to cut, and the other enjoys it. Im not sure if thats some bizarre affection or cruel form of revenge. He shook his head. Probably not that far off from some real relationships, huh?*\r\n\r\n*A muscled man sat across from him on the other side of the desk. He looked uncomfortable.* *Uhh. Yes. Youre right. Heres your gold, he said clumsily. The sound of clattering coins rang out around the room as they were dropped unceremoniously on the wooden desk.*\r\n\r\n*No need to run! I have some tea if y—*\r\n\r\n*No, no, its alright. My friends are waiting for me outside, and we have our next contract to get to. The man was already standing upright and holding the halberd again: both lovely and sick to look at. He turned his back and headed for the door.*\r\n\r\n*It opened with a creak, and the dim room lit up and filled with the noise of passersby and street merchants outside. The man turned around and gave the wizard a sad look. Maybe next time, Ilra. Thanks for the identify spell.*\r\n\r\n*The wizard gave a half-hearted smile and nod, and the muscled man closed the door behind him as he left. The room was quiet and empty once more.*\r\n\r\n*With a sigh, the wizard turned to his tea pot and poured himself a small cup. He seemed smaller than before. He added his usual milk and sugar and began to stir. The coins remained untouched on the desk before him.*\r\n\r\n*Staring at the coins, the wizard sipped his tea and whispered, ever-so-softly, ...probably like all my relationships, at least.*\r\n\r\n&amp;#x200B;\r\n\r\n**See imbalance?

A creature takes 1d6 acid damage when its restrained by the net and again at the end of each of its turns it remains restrained. If the creature is wearing nonmagical metal armor, its armor is partly corroded and takes a permanent and cumulative −1 penalty to the AC it offers whenever it takes acid damage at the end of one of its turns. The armor is destroyed if the penalty reduces its AC to 10. A creature other than you who touches the net takes 1d6 acid damage.\r\n\r\nThe nets sticky composition makes it more difficult to escape that a mundane one. A creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. The net has resistance to all damage types. Dealing 10 slashing damage to the net (AC 12) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and tearing the net apart.\r\n\r\nThe torn net is harmless. If more than half of the net can be salvaged and stored within a container large enough to hold 1 gallon of water for 24 hours, the net is repaired and can be used once more. Your attunement to the net ends if the net remains destroyed for longer than 2 days.\r\n\r\nYoure immune to damage from the net while youre attuned to it.

    "description": "**Tethervine Quiver**  \r\n*Wondrous Item, uncommon*\r\n\r\nThis seemingly overgrown quiver keeps a large plant magically concealed within. The quiver can store up to 20 arrows or bolts. When you draw a piece of ammunition from the quiver, you can speak the quivers command word as a bonus action to magically connect the end of the ammunition to the plant inside the quiver. The plant is a rope-like vine that flies effortlessly behind a fired piece of ammunition. While wearing the quiver, you can use a bonus action to magically retract the vine up to 60 feet back into the quiver. Any object weighing less than 25 pounds that was hit by a connected piece of ammunition is pulled back toward the quiver when its retracted in this way. Despite the quivers limitations, the rope-like vine can hold up to 250 pounds on its own.\r\n\r\nIf you hit a creature with an arrow or bolt that was connected to the vine, the vine magically disconnects itself and falls from the ammunition. You can disconnect the vine from the ammunition by speaking its command word again or sever the vine from the quiver as a bonus action. Once severed, the vine is considered to be a mundane length of hemp rope.\r\n\r\nYou can only fire a connected piece of ammunition as far as you have the vine to. The quiver regrows 1d4 x 10 feet of vine each day at dawn, up to a maximum of 120 feet.\r\n\r\n&amp;#x200B;\r\n\r\n*The overgrown forests of Elsath are a truly awesome sight. The plants seem to move like a painting whose pigments have decided to run amok. Particularly clever adventurers can sometimes manage to take a souvenir home with them.

When you do, the target of the attack takes 1d8 psychic damage and is forced to make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is stunned until the end of your next turn. On a successful save, the creature is not stunned. A construct or undead creature automatically succeeds on the saving throw.

Made with...donated materials from the Ensafrani guild scholars, including our guest here. He gestured to the cleaned corpse on the table.

Each pocket is six inches wide at the mouth and can hold up to 20 pounds material, not exceeding a volume of 2 cubic feet. The pants always weigh 1 pound, regardless of its contents.\n\nPlacing an object in one of the pants pockets follows the normal rules for interacting with objects. Retrieving an item from the pants requires an action as your hand rummages around in side for a few moments before finding the item its looking for.\n\nIf the pants are overloaded, pierced, or torn, they rupture and tear, throwing scattering their contents in a 300-foot radius around you. Casting the *mending* spell on the pants daily for 30 days restores the pants connection to the extradimensional spaces. If one or more pockets are turned inside out, their contents spill forth, unharmed, but the pocket must be put right before it can be used again. Breathing creatures inside the pocket can survive up to a number of minutes equal to 10 divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they begin to suffocate.\n\nPlacing the pants inside an extradimensional space created by a *bag of holding*, *portable hole*, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and cant be reopened.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Pants with pockets is one thing.

While activated, the orb records basic details about the space that it can see within 100 feet. The orb has darkvision out to 100 feet, but cant see through heavily obscured areas or illusions.\n\nThe activated globe can display its recorded maps. If you are within 30 feet of it, you can speak its first command word, followed by a description of a location its mapped. For example, you can command the orb to recall the entrance to a series of catacombs you explored 2 days ago, or the path you took to get through a twisting labyrinth. When you do, an illusory map appears in a 5-foot sphere centered on the globe that shows basic details about the recorded area, such as buildings, pathways, roads, signs, topography, and trees. While youre within 5 feet of the map, you can use a series of intuitive gestures to change the maps rotation, displayed location, or scale: showing as little of the recorded area as a 25-foot radius, or as much as a 1-mile radius. Speaking the command word again causes the map to vanish.\n\nIf you are within 30 feet of it, you can speak a second command word as an action to make the orb rise into the air and float no more than 5 feet off the ground. The globe hovers in this way until you or another creature grasps it. If you move more than 60 feet from the hovering globe, it follows you until it is within 30 feet of you. It takes the shortest route to do so. If prevented from moving, the globe sinks gently to the ground and becomes inactive.\n\nYou can speak a third command word as an action, followed by a location name, while within 30 feet of the floating globe to cause it to move on its own. If the named location has been recorded by the globe and is within 1 mile of you, the sphere moves on its own and floats up to 10 feet ahead of you, guiding you to the named location using any of its recorded maps of the area to guide you. Once you reach your destination or speak the command word again, the globe begins to follow you again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*I hate asking for directions.* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**See imbalance?

Once the needles restrain a target in this way, they cant do so again until the next dawn.\n\nIn addition, you can use the needles as a set of weavers tools. These magical needles can act on their own to either mend a simple tear or craft a simple garment given the proper materials in 1 minute or over the course of a short rest, respectively,.

    "description": "**Green Knight’s Vow** \n *Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*\n These dark green adamantine and copper bracers are granted to devout warriors of the Infernal Court and are designed to match their army's signature tower shields. While wearing the bracers, you grow a sweeping pair of horns from your forehead if you are not a tiefling. If your attunement to the bracers ends, the horns crack and fall away after 24 hours.\n The bracers have a total of 7 charges and regain all expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing them, you can expend 1 or more of their charges to use the following three properties:\n 'Brace Yourselves!' As a bonus action, you can expend 2 or more charges from the bracers to provide cover to a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. For 2 charges, you summon a large, spectral shield that follows the creature for the duration, providing it with half cover. You can summon one extra shield for each additional charge you expend, targeting a different creature with each one. The shields fade at the end of your next turn.\n 'Press the Assault!' When you make an opportunity attack, you can expend 1 or more of the bracers' charges to embolden your nearby allies. For each charge you spend, one creature of your choice within 60 feet of you can use its reaction to make one weapon attack. The chosen creatures must be able to see or hear you.\n 'You Will Burn!' You can expend 1 or more charges from the bracers to cast the hellish rebuke spell (save DC 15) from them. For 1 charge, you cast the 3rd-level version of the spell. You can increase the spell slot level by one for each additional charge you expend. The fire from this spell is a haunting emerald green.\n Flaw. The Green Knight's vow makes its wearer tremendously loyal to royalty. While attuned to the bracers, you gain the following flaw: 'I will stand by my sovereign leader, no matter what.' You or your GM determine who your leader is. In addition, if you are attuned to the bracers for 24 consecutive hours, your commitment to duty drives you to the brink of zealotry. You can't attune to the Red Queen's burden or the Violet King's promise. If you are already attuned to either of them, your attunement to it immediately ends once this effect is extended to you. The first creature you meet who is attuned to either of these weapons becomes your sovereign leader, regardless of who you previously considered it to be. You become charmed by them and obey their commands to the best of your ability. If you find the Red Queen's burden or the Violet King's promise without an owner, you are compelled to protect it with your life until a rightful owner is found. These effects can be removed with a greater restoration spell, but not while you are attuned to the bracers.\n When the crowns clashed and the land burned, the green knights stood by the side, watching, unable to act. No one cursed them though, for they knew a knight cannot serve two monarchs.",

The rod has a tapered spike on one end and an open, tower-like chimney on the other. Three hinged legs unfold from the sides of the rod, allowing it to stand upright with its spiked end pointed downward. Standing or collapsing the rod in this way requires an action.\n\nThe unfolded legs magically fasten the rod to the ground while its standing, but a creature can use its action to try to push it over with a successful DC 17 Strength check. Once the rod is no longer standing, it magically deactivates and collapses itself again.\n\nAs a bonus action, you can press a button on the standing rod to cause its mechanisms to churn and whir, repeatedly sending its spike into the ground below it. Pressing the button again deactivates the rod. The spike sends out loud, drum-like shockwaves every 6 seconds. The waves are audible out to 300 feet, or 1200 feet if a creature has tremorsense. If a creature has tremorsense, its range is halved while its within 300 feet of the active rod.

    "description": "**Underworld Asphodel Regalia**  \n*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*\n\nThis set of royal finery was worn by a noble necromancer with a unique appreciation for the quality of life that extends beyond death. Asphodel blossoms, representing life beyond the tomb, ornament this enchanted outfit. The lush flowers in its laurel crown are nestled among long-dead leaves.\n\nWhile wearing the regalia, you can use it to cast the *animate dead* spell a number of times equal to your spellcasting ability modifier. You regain all expended uses daily at dusk. When you create an undead using a necromancy spell, the creatures hit point maximum is increased by an amount equal to five times your spellcasting ability modifier. In addition, when you cast a spell that deals necrotic damage, you can add your spellcasting ability modifier to one damage roll of that spell.\n\n***Chthonic Commands.*** As an action, you can issue a command of either dismissal or obedience to an undead creature within 60 feet of you. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, you can impose one of the following effects on that creature for 1 minute:\n\n* The creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it cant willingly move into a space within 30 feet of you. It also cant take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If it has nowhere it can move, the creature can use the Dodge action. This effect ends early if that creature takes any damage.\n* The creature is charmed by you. While the creature is charmed, you have a telepathic link with it as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence. You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as Attack that creature, Run over there, or Fetch that object. If the creature completes the order and doesnt receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability. Each time the creature takes damage, it makes a new Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. If the saving throw succeeds, the effect ends.\n\nYou can use this property a number of times equal to your spellcasting ability modifier. You regain all expended uses daily at dusk.\n\n***Ruler of the Dead.*** You are always under the effects of the *sanctuary* spell. This version of the spell only affects undead. If you attack or cast a spell that affects an undead creature, that creature is immune to this spells effects for 24 hours.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*For years, we complied to the shackle of mortality that had been placed on us by the greater powers. Looking down upon us with enough disdain to allow us to die whilst jealously guarding immortality for themselves. Why was it fair for them to withhold eternity from us, just because we were born human? It was no wonder that at the first moment we could, we forsook them for the only being who could shatter our shackles: the Deathless.*\n\n*The Deathless was the power that ruled the Underworld. We begged the Deathless to let us live. We begged for freedom from the emptiness of death. We wailed the lamentations of our souls and laid our breasts bare for the Deathless. We slashed our arms and spilled our blood. For years did we pine for the Deathless attention, suffering every innumerable pain endurable by our fragile mortal shells. Yet even with all this, the Deathless remained silent.*\n\n*With naught but a heart determined to see our people weep no more, one from amongst our number declared that if the Deathless would turn a deaf ear to us, then he would force the Deathless to hear our demands. He would walk alone, and stride the path to the very Underworld itself. There, he, burdened with the yolk of our sorrows, would find a cure for death.*\n\n*We assured him that his intent was steeped with madness, but his will was iron, and before the first light of the next dawn, he departed us. We never expected his return.*\n\n*It was not until a year and a day had passed did we see him again. He looked unwell; sickly pale and devoid of all but the bleakest of emotions. Yet, he strode home atop a glinting chariot of silver pulled by a black stallion, head held high and clothed in macabre finery. Whats more...he had not returned alone. His chariot was trailed closely by a retinue of pale figures most familiar to us. Our fathers &amp; mothers. Our grandfathers &amp; grandmothers. Our great grandfathers &amp; great grandmothers. Generations of our long passed family, right up to our thrice-great grandparents, followed behind the one that survived the realm of the Deathless...and they were smiling. He had done what he promised. He had found a cure for death.*\n\n*Such a feeling of euphoria enveloped our beaten hearts, that all at once we fell to our knees as he passed, and pressed our heads to the ground with reverence. For three days after, and for the first time in years, we celebrated. Wine was drunk, feasts were eaten, and songs were sung.*\n\n*When the celebration of the return had ended, it was followed by a coronation of He Who Conquered Death. Though he was born low and though he did refuse at first, we agreed to place the laurel of the people atop his head, for only one who had trod the paths of the Underworld was worthy to be our king.*\n\n*—Excerpt from Chapter VI: The King of the Underworld from* Tales of Ages Long Past *by Alder Drycholn.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Did you miss the** [**Kickstarter**](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/thegriffonssaddlebag/more-magic-items-for-5e-the-griffons-saddlebag-book-one)**?** No sweat!

Once picked, the flower can survive up to 7 days before it withers and dies. You can use an action to pull off and drop one of the flowers five petals. When you do, there is a 5% chance that the petal glimmers in a flash of light as a rune is burnt into it, recreating the effects of the *augury* spell. When it does, a new *fortunes flower* grows at that petals location after 30 days if the ground is suited for growth.\n\nIn the wild, a *fortunes flower* is often found with 1d6 – 3 others nearby.

    "description": "**Violet Kings Promise**  \n*Weapon (rapier), legendary (requires attunement by a bard, cleric, paladin, or ranger)*\n\nThis elegant brass rapier was originally wielded by a beloved king, whose empathy and care for his subjects lives on within the blade. When you hit with an attack using this magic sword, the target takes an extra 1d8 fire damage. In addition, you can use this rapier as a spellcasting focus.\n\nThe rapier has 7 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. While holding it, a number of gems inside the guard equal to the weapons remaining charges glow red. When you expend a charge from the rapier, it releases a plume of dark smoke from one of the gems.\n\nIf an attacker makes a spell attack against you or a target within 5 feet of you while youre holding the rapier, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. If the attack misses and was a spell of 1st level or higher, you regain 1 expended charge.\n\nWhile holding the rapier, you can expend 1 or more of its charges to give one of three decrees that affect the flow of magic and battle:\n\n***Clemency.*** When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that restores hit points to a single creature, you can use your reaction to expend 2 charges to cause a different creature within 10 feet of the original target to regain 1d8 hit points per spell level. When you do, each creature has advantage on the next ability check or saving throw it makes before the end of its next turn.\n\n***Condemn.*** When you cast a spell that deals damage to a single creature, you can use your reaction to expend 2 charges to cause that target as well as a different creature within 10 feet of it to make a Charisma saving throw using your spell save DC. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d8 fire damage and has disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much fire damage and makes its next attack roll as normal.\n\n***Overrule.*** When you roll dice to restore hit points to a single creature or roll damage for a spell attack or attack using this weapon, you can expend up to 2 charges (no action required) to change the result of those dice. For each charge you spend, you can use the highest number possible for two of those dice instead of the numbers you rolled.\n\n***Flaw.*** The *Violet Kings promise* makes its wielder empathic and reluctant to resort to violence. While attuned to the weapon, you gain the following flaw: I am slow to resort to violence, even if its at the cost of my own safety. In addition, if you are attuned to the weapon for 24 consecutive hours, your soft-heartedness causes you to lose your ferocity and battle-readiness. You have disadvantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks and suffer a –5 penalty to initiative. These effects can be be removed with a *greater restoration* spell, but not while you are attuned to the weapon.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*The kings love was endless and often to his own detriment. While he cared, his people thrived. That is, until he met the Queen.*\n\n*Their spark was one for the ages. His calm and serene grace was a benevolent counterpoint to Her aggressive tendencies. Under their combined rule, the kingdoms rejoiced, and their reign spread. They were a bastion of compromise and balance, and there was seemingly nothing they could not handle together.*\n\n*To celebrate their love, the King commissioned two royal blades from a curious smith: a deft and clever rapier to match his wit, and a powerful, steadfast glaive to harness her powerful reach.*\n\n*The smith was none other than a vengeful genie, whose lands had been occupied and family slain by the Queens imperialist militias. He crafted two stunning blades to match the Kings request, but traced into them a powerful, digging magic that would ultimately be their undoing.*\n\n*The blades never left the pairs side. Whats more, their personalities grew more intensely divided. What was once a relation of compromise was now a battle for authority.*\n\n*Less than a year went by before the Kingdom was split. Civil war between those that believed that the Queens strong hand meant safety, and the other that believed the Kings empathy led to a sustainable future.*\n\n*Some histories claim the Queens anger overran the King. Others say the Kings kindness outlasted the Queens fiery temper. One thing is for certain: in the end, the only winner was the genie.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Did you miss the** [**Kickstarter**](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/thegriffonssaddlebag/more-magic-items-for-5e-the-griffons-saddlebag-book-one)**?** No sweat!

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. The bonus increase to +3 while you are underwater.\n When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon against a creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or begin to suffocate. At the end of each of its turns, a creature suffocating in this way can make another Constitution saving throw. On a successful save or when it drops to 0 hit points, the creature can breathe again. A suffocating creature can't speak. A creature is immune to this effect if it doesn't need to breathe or has legendary actions.\n Release the Kraken. You can use an action to speak the trident's command word to open a 15-foot-radius eldritch gate centered on a point you can see on the ground within 60 feet of you, turning the ground in the area into difficult terrain. If you are underwater, the point does not need to be on the ground. The gate is one-way. When the gate opens, up to 3 massive kraken tentacles appear through the gate, forcing any Large or smaller creature in the tentacle's space into the nearest unoccupied space. Each tentacle is treated as a Large monstrosity with 60 hit points, AC 18, a reach of 30 feet, immunity to all conditions, and a +7 bonus to all ability checks and saving throws. A tentacle can move anywhere within the gate's area on your turn (no action required) without provoking opportunity attacks. You can use your reaction to make an attack of opportunity with the tentacle. A tentacle remains until it falls to 0 hit points or the gate closes.\n When the tentacles appear, they immediately make up to 3 melee attacks, one with each tentacle, against targets you can see within the tentacles' reach with an attack bonus of +10. On a hit, a target takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage, and if the target is Large or smaller, it is also grappled (escape DC 17). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained. Each tentacle can grapple one target. A creature that ends its turn and is restrained by a tentacle takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage.\n While at least one tentacle remains, you can use an action to repeat these attacks, making one with each tentacle. If an object is held or a creature is grappled by a tentacle, you can throw it up to 60 feet away in a random direction, knocking it prone, instead of attacking with the tentacle. If a thrown target strikes a solid surface, the target takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked prone.\nThe gate stays open for 1 minute. It closes early if you dismiss it using a bonus action or if you drop to 0 hit points. Once this property of the trident has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.\nMy power runs deep. Deeper than the river, the sea, the ocean. I know it, for I've seen it.

    "description": "**Arcanist Gauntlets**  \n*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*\n\nThis pair of rich silk gloves are guarded by an enchanted mithral shell that sporadically releases arcane power. You can use the gauntlets as a spellcasting focus while wearing them, and when you cast a spell using a 1st through 5th-level spell slot, you can choose to roll a d6. If you roll a number on the d6 equal to or greater than the spell slot level you used to cast the spell, the spell is cast from the gauntlets without expending a spell slot. Otherwise, you cast the spell as normal. The gauntlets can cast up to 5 levels worth of spell slots in this way each day, and no two can be cast using the same level slot.\n\nYou can attempt to cast a spell in this way even if you dont have the slot to cast it. The slot must be of a level you can normally cast. If you attempt to cast a spell in this way and roll a number lower than its slot level on the d6, the spell is not cast, the action is wasted, and the slot is counted toward the gauntlets daily spell slot level maximum.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*The gnolls snarled and crept toward the pair of dwarves, savoring their dread.

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. The sword has 10 charges and regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn.\n\nAs an action, you can hold the sword out in front of you and speak its command word to expend up to 5 of its charges, causing a jet of flame to erupt from it. When you do, the sword emits a roar thats audible out to 100 feet, and you must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed back 20 feet for each charge you expend. You can choose to fail this saving throw, whose DC equals 10 + the number of charges you expend. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks. Pointing the blade down and expending charges in this way launches you upward instead. If you do and you are not launched, the swords flames spread out in a 15-foot-radius circle, centered on you.\n\nThe jet of flame spreads out in a 15-foot cone and moves with you if youre pushed. Any creature in the area when the flame either appears or moves into its space must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d6 fire damage, or half as much fire damage on a success. The fire damage increases by 1d6 for each additional charge you expend beyond the first.\n\nIf you strike an object because of this forced movement, such as a wall or floor, you take 1d6 bludgeoning damage for each charge you expended and are knocked prone.

Despite the armors larger size, a series of clever harnesses inside its chest piece comfortably support you inside it. While wearing this armor, your Strength score is 19, unless its already higher, and you are considered to be a Medium creature. Magic currents run through the inside of the armor and connect to you, allowing you to control the metal limbs as if they were your own. This magical connection causes you to still take any damage you receive while wearing the armor.\n\nWhile wearing this armor, you can use a bonus action to speak its command word to force the armor to move more rapidly. When it does, you gain the effect of the *haste* spell (no concentration required), and the armors joints creak and groan from the increased strain. At the end of each of your turns while youre under this effect, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance that the armor overheats.

Each hollow section is capped with a ring of glass, allowing you to see inside the rod and know how much water is stored inside.\n\nWhile holding the open end of the rod underwater, you can speak its command word as an action to cause it to begin absorbing water for the next minute. The rod can only absorb water. If the rod is submerged in this way for the full duration, it absorbs 10 gallons of water. The rod can hold up to 40 gallons at any time in this way, and can absorb up to 100 each day.\n\nYou can use an action to speak one of the rods other two command words. When you speak the first word, you cast the *create or destroy water* spell (Create Water only) from the rod. You can cast this at up to 4th level in this way. Each gallon of water you create as part of the spell is drawn from the pool of water within the rod. If you cast this spell from the rod and cause the water to fall as rain, the spell consumes 10 gallons of water for each of the spells slot levels.\n\nThe second command word causes 10 or more gallons of water to erupt from the rod in a torrent of water, up to the maximum amount remaining within the rod. This water is drawn from the pool of water within the rod. The water is shot in a line 30 feet long and 1 foot wide. Any creature in the line must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw.

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. If it hits a stone object, the hit is automatically a critical hit.\n\nIn addition, you can use an action to speak the handaxes command word and strike a fixed stone surface with it, such as a wall or ceiling. If the surface is no more than 2 feet thick, it magically pulls apart to form a temporary doorway. The doorway is no more than 5 feet across in any dimension and closes at the end of your next turn, leaving no trace of it behind. The passage creates no instability in a structure surrounding it. When the opening disappears, any creatures or objects still in the doorway created by the handaxe are ejected to an unoccupied space on a random side of the stone surface and take 1d6 bludgeoning damage.

The elf had been the deciding factor in a fight to save the realm from the Venom Queens brood, and, as reward, was given unfettered access to the mines. However, the High Overseer said that there was something she must first see in order to understand the magnitude of such a gift. As they moved deeper into the finely hewn tunnels, her sense of unease grew. Was this a trap? An assassination?*\n\n*Her worries ceased and her breath was cut short when the tunnels opened into a grand hall. The walls were covered in murals that depicted the history of Direstone, including its mines and its people. Arrayed across the room in brilliant gold and stone were heroes and monsters, rulers and craftsmen. They walked across the room in silence as Lanwen took in the sheer spectacle of it, stopping at a wall that portrayed the citys first king.*\n\n*The grim dwarves stood in silence for an uncomfortable moment. Just as Lanwen steeled herself to speak, a dwarf dressed in shining armor stepped forward: a Keybearer. To her surprise, the dwarf pulled out an ornate axe and, with a burst of force, slammed it into the wall. From the axes blade, the wall of stone split apart to reveal a twisting passage. As the sound rang out through the hall, Lanwen was unceremoniously ushered inside, ducking her head to do so, before the passage closed behind them to leave them in darkness.*\n\n*Suddenly, torches arranged through the dark space sputtered to life to reveal the room before them. Piles of glimmering gold and wondrous finery that matched even the quality of the elder fey.

The creature must be able to see and hear you. If the attack hits, it deals an extra 2d6 fire damage.\n\n***Survive.*** As a bonus action, you can expend 1 or more charges to grant a creature other than you temporary hit points equal to your Strength modifier plus 5 times the number of charges you expend. The creature must be able to see and hear you.\n\n***Cower.*** When you hit a target with the glaive, you can expend 2 charges to exude an imposing aura of dominance. All hostile creatures within 15 feet of you must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn. The target of the attack has disadvantage on the saving throw.\n\nAlternatively, while holding the glaive, you can expend 2 of its charges at the start of your turn to become an unyielding pillar of defense.

Did you get this vase?*\n\n*From somewhere else in the house another voice replied back, No, sweety, it was left for us outside. I think its from the Hawkins. Ive sent a messenger there to thank them.*\n\n*Firell continued to eye the vase, Ah, that makes sense. How nice of them. He went back to sorting through papers. God awful taste, those Hawkins. What a tacky thing.*\n\n*The vase suddenly began to wobble. Its lid cracked open before shutting once more. Next to the vase stood a towering half-orc, sword in hand. He stooped down to look at the vase in more detail, Hmm, well,* ***I*** *dont think its tacky. I worked hard to pick out this pattern. Everyone else said they liked it, too.*\n\n*Firell stared in disbelief, the papers now hanging loosely in his hands.*\n\n*The half-orc stood up, suddenly realizing his error. He covered his face with a large hand and slowly dragged it down and off his stubbled chin.*\n\n*The two stared at one another for a long pause.*\n\n*Well, this is awkward, said the half-orc. Tell you what, you give me those keys like I came here for, I leave this surprisingly* ***un-tacky*** *vase here, and you tell the Hawkins you love their gift. Win-win, right?*\n\n*Firell blinked several times, shook his head, and started to slowly turn his head and open his mouth. The half-orc held up a hand and continued:*\n\n*The alternative is I kill you, take your keys,* ***and*** *take the pretty vase back with me.*\n\n*Firells mouth closed, his shoulders slumped, and reached for his keys once more. He held them out with trembling fingers.*\n\n*Satisfied, the half-orc took them. Thank you, that was much easier. Now, last thing, I want to hear you call the vase beautiful.

When you do, a magical, spectral door slowly appears in front of you over the course of 1 minute, duplicating the effect of the *magnificent mansion* spell with the following change.

A creature can visit the library and attempt to uncover a piece of knowledge, such as ancient poetry, the history of a forgotten kingdom, or the family lineage of a tyrannical king. The GM determines the checks and DCs needed to locate a given piece of information.

The wings give you a flying speed of 60 feet.\n\nAlternatively, while holding the wand, you can use a bonus action to expend 1 of its charges to cause the wings to appear on the back of a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. When you do, that creature can immediately use its reaction to fly up to its movement speed, without provoking opportunity attacks. At the end of the turn, the wings vanish.\n\n***Healing Light.*** While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend 1 or more charges from the wand to cause a beam of healing light to shine down on a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The creature regains 10 hit points for each charge you spend and is cured of either one disease or one condition afflicting it. The condition can be blinded, deafened, paralyzed, or poisoned. If a creature regains hit points in this way that would take it above its hit point maximum, that creature gains temporary hit points equal to the number of restored hit points above its hit point maximum.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Her Majesty was royal, but in name only.

Wracked with anger and spite for the people who led him to his death, it was only then that she realized the impact he had on the royal family. The sitting king and queen, as well as their son, paid her a visit to offer their sympathy and support: an early act of kindness that would shape her growth from her fathers loss.*\n\n*Moved to noble studies and quarters, she grew to befriend the young prince. Time passed, and as is typical in stories such as this, the two fell in love. Set to become the future queen of Orostead, she spent her days studying the nobility, law, and history of the city. Using her meager upbringing as context for her opinion, she could see that many generations of corruption and ill-practiced law threatened to consume the city and leave it a husk of its former glory.*\n\n*But the prince grew sick before their coronation. Too sick. One night after reading to him in their bed, she fell asleep. She tossed and turned with nightmares of plague and ruin. Just when she could feel the last of her hope begin to slip away, a light broke through to rid her of the darkness: a shimmering pegasus with the horn of a unicorn.*\n\n*It was there that she bargained with the spirit. In exchange for some of its divine power, she would ward off the darkness that threatened to consume them. When she awoke, she found a feather and horn clutched in her hands.*\n\n*From then on, the would-be queen nursed her prince back to health, learning the extent of her magic as she went. The prince survived, although his legs would no longer serve him. The two were crowned king and queen, and while the king could often be found in his study or poring over new laws or the grievances of his people, the queen became the voice of the city and its people.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Did you miss the Kickstarter?** No sweat!

    "description": "**Masks of the Sacred Beasts**  \n*Wondrous item, rarity varies (requires attunement)*\n\nThese dark ceramic and gold masks are fashioned after animals that are sacred in certain cultures. Each masks appearance and properties are based on the sacred beast it represents. While attuned to a mask, you can end your attunement to it and attune to a different one over the course of 1 minute, instead of over the course of one or more short rests.\n\n***Crocodile (Common).*** While wearing a crocodile mask, you gain a swimming speed of 30 feet and can hold your breath for up to 10 minutes at a time.\n\n***Lion (Uncommon).*** While wearing a lion mask, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell. In addition, your nails extend into claws, turning your unarmed strikes with your hands into magic weapons that deal slashing damage with a damage die of 1d6.\n\n***Hawk (Rare).*** While wearing a hawk mask, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight, and attacking at long range doesnt impose disadvantage on your ranged attack rolls. In addition, you can cast the *feather fall* spell at will, targeting yourself only.\n\n***Mule (Very Rare).*** While wearing a mule mask, you count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift, and you have advantage on Strength and Dexterity ability checks and saving throws against being knocked prone. In addition, while wearing the mask, you can use a bonus action when you hit a Large or smaller creature with melee weapon attack to force that creature to make a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (its choice) The DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone.\n\n***Jackal (Legendary).*** While wearing a jackal mask, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and immunity to necrotic damage. In addition, you can use an action to fire a beam of deathly green magic from your forehead at a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 7d8 + 30 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\nIf the creature is reduced to 0 hit points in this way and is a humanoid, that creature rises at the start of your next turn as a mummy under your control. The mummy acts on its own initiative count. On your turn, you can mentally command the mummy if it is within 120 feet of you and you arent incapacitated. You decide what action the mummy takes and where it moves during its next turn, or you can issue it a general command, such as to attack your enemies or guard a location.\n\nThe mummy remains until you dismiss it as a bonus action or until its reduced to 0 hit points, causing it to turn to dust. You can only create and control one mummy at a time in this way. Once this property of the mask has been used, it cant be used again until the next dusk.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*We came upon a group of warriors this morning by mistake. Larenth, who had been holding the bulk of our supplies and cookware, gave away our location with a sharp bang and clatter as they tripped and fell. The band of warriors turned to look at us in unison, their faces covered in dark and foreboding crocodile masks with movements filled with the strength and purpose of true predators. It was a moment that seemed to drag on forever, and I could no longer hear the nearby river over the sound of the blood pounding in my ears.*\n\n*We escaped, for lack of a better word, unfollowed for a panic-ridden minute. We assumed they didnt plan to give chase, since we didnt hear the sound of moving underbrush behind us. How wrong we were.*\n\n*We stopped after another minute to catch our breaths, hiding in a secluded glen under a fallen pine. Just as we thought we were safe, we saw the warriors once more—now holding spears and wearing masks of lions, hawks, and jackals.*\n\n*Once more my blood pounded in my ears. It was so loud I feared the warriors would hear it as clearly as I was. One of the warriors, a woman in a lions mask, sniffed the air and turned to the old pine under which we sat. She said something to her companions and walked to where we hid, holding her spear in one hand and something else in the other.*\n\n*She walked to the tree and placed a mask on the ground: a mules. Without a word, she returned to the rest of the group and vanished as easily as they had come.*\n\n*—excerpt from the diary of Garold, the soldier*",

While holding the torch, you can use a bonus action to speak its first command word, causing eerie blue flames to appear above the head of the torch. The flames cast bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The flames are not extinguished when immersed in water and last until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you stow the torch.\n\nYou can use an action while holding the lit torch to speak its second or third command word. Speaking the second command word causes any illusion within the torchs bright light to be outlined in blue, green, or violet (your choice) for 1 minute. The torch cant be used this way again until the next dawn.\n\nSpeaking the third command word causes the flame to fly from the torch and erupt at a point you can see within 60 feet of you, creating an explosion of blue flames and duplicating the effect of the *faerie fire* spell (save DC 13, no concentration required) in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered at that point. On a failed save. a creature also takes 2d6 fire damage. You can end the spell early using a bonus action. When the spell ends, the flame reappears above the torch.

    "description": "**Gorget of the Holy Soldier**  \n*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a good-aligned creature)*\n\nThis magical gorget is imbued with the divine power of a planetar and has been passed down through multiple generations, manifesting a different power for each wearer. While wearing the gorget, you have resistance to radiant damage and gain the following benefits. If you have a feature that allows you to ignore class, race, or level requirements when you use a magic item, you can choose to gain the benefits of one of these properties. You make this choice the first time you attune to the item.\n\n***Investiture of the Planetar.*** If you have 10 or more levels in the barbarian class, your Strength score increases by 2, to a maximum of 26, and while youre raging, any creature you hit with a melee weapon attack takes an extra 1d6 radiant damage.\n\n***Litany of Heaven.*** If you have 10 or more levels in the bard class, you gain the ability to speak and understand all languages. In addition, whenever you give a creature a Bardic Inspiration die, that creature regains a number of hit points equal to twice your Charisma modifier.\n\n***Divine Judge &amp; Jury.*** If you have 10 or more levels in the cleric class, you always have the *commune*, *dispel evil and good*, and *raise dead* spells prepared, and they dont count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. In addition, when you cast *raise dead* using a spell slot, you can choose to cast it as an action, instead of its normal casting time. When you do, the spell requires no material components and returns the target to life with half its maximum hit points. Once this property has been used, it can’t be used again until 7 days have passed.\n\n***Herald of Omens.*** If you have 10 or more levels in the druid class, the gorget becomes covered in vines and leaves. While wearing it, you always have the *control weather* and *insect plague* spells prepared, and they dont count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. In addition, you can use a bonus action to summon a pair of white-feathered wings from your back. While the wings exist, you have a flying speed of 60 feet. The wings last until youre incapacitated, you die, or until you dismiss them as a bonus action.\n\n***Unstoppable Legionnaire.*** If you have 10 or more levels in the fighter class, you cant be charmed or frightened, and you gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks.\n\n***Angelic Grace.*** If you have 10 or more levels in the monk class, your walking speed increases by 10 feet, and you have advantage on ability checks to resist being grappled. In addition, while you arent wearing any armor, you gain a +2 bonus to your AC.\n\n***Caress of Life.*** If you have 10 or more levels in the paladin class, your Lay on Hands pool of healing power increases by 10 hit points. In addition, you can expend 10 hit points from your pool of healing to end the effects of blindness, deafness, or paralysis on a creature. Alternatively, you can expend 15 hit points from the pool to end a curse affecting a creature or object, as if by the *remove curse* spell.\n\n***Sight of Celestial Warder.*** If you have 10 or more levels in the ranger class, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and gain Truesight out to 15 feet. In addition, you can see up to 1 mile away with no difficulty and are able to discern fine details as though looking at something from no more than 100 feet away.\n\n***Heavenly Messenger.*** If you have 10 or more levels in the rogue class, you can use a bonus action to cast the *invisibility* spell (no concentration required) from the gorget, targeting yourself only. Once the spell has been cast, it cant be cast again until you finish a short or long rest. In addition, you can speak telepathically to any creature within 30 feet of you. The creature understands you only if the two of you share a language. You can speak telepathically in this way to one creature at a time.\n\n***Luminous Soul.*** If you have 10 or more levels in the sorcerer class, you learn the *light* and *dancing lights* cantrips as well as the *guiding bolt* spell, which dont count against your number of cantrips or sorcerer spells known. You can cast *guiding bolt* by spending 2 sorcery points or by expending a spell slot. If you cast it with sorcery points and hit a target, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or be blinded until the start of your next turn. In addition, when you cast a spell that deals damage, you can spend 1 sorcery point to change its damage type to radiant.\n\n***Pact of Veracious Awareness.*** If you have 10 or more levels in the warlock class, you know if you hear a lie. If you hear a creature tell a lie, you can attempt to force that creature to tell the truth. The creature must make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC or be compelled to answer the next question you ask it truthfully. You can use the ability a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier, and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\n***Celestial Wards.*** If you have 10 or more levels in the wizard class, your AC becomes 13 + your Dexterity or Intelligence modifier (your choice). In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Thou who art most holy and good, be not afraid. I appear before thee bearing great tidings. In accordance with the decrees of the immaculate gods of the Mounting Heavens, thou hath been named champion, and hath been chosen to bear the treasure that befits thy station. Kneel, o’ blessed one.

When you throw this item, a playful animal spirit appears beside you and chases after it. Immediately after you throw it, the spirit returns the ball to you.\nYou can attach the bounder's ball to the base of a weapon with the thrown property by pressing it against the weapon for at least 10 minutes. Once you do, you can use a bonus action to speak the ball's command word to cause the weapon to shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. Speaking the command word again or stowing the weapon puts out the light. When you make a ranged attack with the glowing weapon, the ball's animal spirit appears and happily retrieves it. Immediately after the attack, the spirit returns the weapon to your hand or drops it at your feet (your choice).\nYou can remove the ball from the weapon over the course of a short rest by gently tugging at it, as if from an animal's mouth. The spirit is ethereal and doesn't occupy any space. If you have a companion's band, the spirit can interact with the one created by the band.\nSome dogs play fetch with sticks. Mine plays it with daggers.\n",

Creatures wearing metal armor have disadvantage on the save. Poison Spray. The cannon expels poison gas in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 22 (4d10) poison damage and is poisoned for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't poisoned. A creature poisoned in this way can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.",

When thrown, the prosthetic detaches and flies at the target of the attack, then immediately returns to you and reattaches. Thrown. If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.",

    "description": "Seeing the peril his people faced, a young dwarf prince came to believe that his people needed something to unite them. Thus, he set out to forge a weapon that would be such a symbol.Venturing deep under the mountains, deeper than any dwarf had ever delved, the young prince came to the blazing heart of a great volcano. With the aid of Moradin, the dwarven god of creation, he first crafted four great tools: the Brutal Pick, the Earthheart Forge, the Anvil of Songs, and the Shaping Hammer. With them, he forged the Axe of the Dwarvish Lords.Armed with the artifact, the prince returned to the dwarf clans and brought peace. His axe ended grudges and answered slights. The clans became allies, and they threw back their enemies and enjoyed an era of prosperity. This young dwarf is remembered as the First King. When he became old, he passed the weapon, which had become his badge of office, to his heir. The rightful inheritors passed the axe on for many generations.Later, in a dark era marked by treachery and wickedness, the axe was lost in a bloody civil war fomented by greed for its power and the status it bestowed. Centuries later, the dwarves still search for the axe, and many adventurers have made careers of chasing after rumors and plundering old vaults to find it. Magic Weapon. The Axe of the Dwarvish Lords is a magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The axe also functions as a belt of dwarvenkind, a dwarven thrower, and a sword of sharpness. Random Properties. The axe has the following randomly determined properties:2 minor beneficial properties1 major beneficial property2 minor detrimental properties Blessings of Moradin. If you are a dwarf attuned to the axe, you gain the following benefits:You have immunity to poison damage.The range of your darkvision increases by 60 feet.You gain proficiency with artisan's tools related to blacksmithing, brewing, and stonemasonry. Conjure Earth Elemental. If you are holding the axe, you can use your action to cast the conjure elemental spell from it, summoning an earth elemental. You can't use this property again until the next dawn. Travel the Depths. You can use an action to touch the axe to a fixed piece of dwarven stonework and cast the teleport spell from the axe. If your intended destination is underground, there is no chance of a mishap or arriving somewhere unexpected. You can't use this property again until 3 days have passed. Curse. The axe bears a curse that affects any non-dwarf that becomes attuned to it. Even if the attunement ends, the curse remains. With each passing day, the creature's physical appearance and stature become more dwarflike. After seven days, the creature looks like a typical dwarf, but the creature neither loses its racial traits nor gains the racial traits of a dwarf. The physical changes wrought by the axe aren't considered magical in nature (and therefore can't be dispelled), but they can be undone by any effect that removes a curse, such as a greater restoration or remove curse spell. Destroying the Axe. The only way to destroy the axe is to melt it down in the Earthheart Forge, where it was created. It must remain in the burning forge for fifty years before it finally succumbs to the fire and is consumed. Thrown. If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property. Versatile. This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.",

The shield spell provides no defense against the axe, which passes through that spell's barrier of magical force.When you hit a fiend or an undead with the axe, cold blue flames erupt from its blade and deal an extra 2d6 radiant damage to the target. Hurling. The battleaxe has 3 charges. You can expend 1 charge and make a ranged attack with the axe, hurling it as if it had the thrown property with a normal range of 60 feet and a long range of 180 feet. Whether it hits or misses, the axe flies back to you at the end of the current turn, landing in your open hand or at your feet in your space (as you choose). The axe regains all expended charges daily at dawn. Illumination. While holding the axe, you can use an action to cause the axe to glow blue or to quench the glow. This glow sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Sentience. Azuredge is a sentient lawful neutral weapon with an Intelligence of 12, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 15. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common. It has a calm, delicate voice. The weapon can sense the presence of non-lawful creatures within 120 feet of it. Personality. Azuredge is sworn to protect Waterdeep, and it desires to be wielded by a law-abiding person willing to dedicate everything to the city's defense. The weapon is patient and takes its time finding its ideal wielder.If someone tries to use Azuredge against its will, the axe can become ten times heavier than normal, and can magically adhere to any Medium or larger object or surface it comes into contact with. Once it does so, the axe can't be wielded. Nothing short of a wish spell can separate the axe from the item or surface to which it is adhered without destroying one or the other, though the axe can choose to end the effect at any time. Versatile. This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.",

Whenever you use it to reduce a creature to 0 hit points, the sword slays the creature devours its soul, unless it is a construct or an undead. A creature whose soul has been devoured by Blackrazor can be restored to life only by a wish spell.When it devours a soul, Blackrazor grants you temporary hit points equal to the slain creature's hit point maximum. These hit points fade after 24 hours. As long as these temporary hit points last and you keep Blackrazor in hand, you have advantage on attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks.If you hit an undead with this weapon, you take 1d10 necrotic damage and the target regains 1d10 hit points.

While you hold the weapon. you are aware of the presence of Tiny or larger creatures within 60 feet of you that aren't constructs or undead. You also can't be charmed or frightened.Blackrazor can cast the haste spell on you once per day. It decides when to cast the spell and maintains concentration on it so that you don't have to. Sentience. Blackrazor is a sentient chaotic neutral weapon with an Intelligence of 17, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 19. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.The weapon can speak, read, and understand Common, and can communicate with its wielder telepathically. Its voice is deep and echoing. While you are attuned to it, Blackrazor also understands every language you know. Personality. Blackrazor speaks with an imperious tone, as though accustomed to being obeyed.The sword's purpose is to consume souls. It doesn't care whose souls it eats, including the wielder's. The sword believes that all matter and energy sprang from a void of negative energy and will one day return to it. Blackrazor is meant to hurry that process along.Despite its nihilism, Blackrazor feels a strange kinship to Wave and Whelm, two other weapons locked away under White Plume Mountain. It wants the three weapons to be united again and wielded together in combat, even though it violently disagrees with Whelm and finds Wave tedious.Blackrazor's hunger for souls must be regularly fed. If the sword goes three days or more without consuming a soul, a conflict between it and its wielder occurs at the next sunset. Heavy. Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively. Two-Handed. This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.",

    "description": "The Blackstaff is a sentient, rune-carved staff set with thin silver veins. It is the symbol of office for the Blackstaff, the highest-ranking wizard in Waterdeep. As the rightful owner of the Blackstaff, Vajra Safahr is the only one who can become attuned to it. The staff can, however, choose a new owner (see Personality below).This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. While holding it, you gain a +2 bonus to Armor Class, saving throws, and spell attack rolls.The staff has 20 charges for the following properties. The staff regains 2d8 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff retains its +2 bonus to attack and damage roll but loses all other properties. On a 20, the staff regain 1d8 + 2 charges. Power Strike. When you hit with a melee attack using the staff, you can expend 1 charge to deal an extra 1d6 force damage to the target. Spells. While holding this staff, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spell attack bonus: cone of cold (5 charges), fireball (5th-level version, 5 charges), globe of invulnerability (6 charges), hold monster (5 charges), levitate (2 charges). lightning bolt (5th-level version, 5 charges), magic missile (1 charge), ray of enfeeblement (1 charge), or wall of force (5 charges). Retributive Strike. You can use an action to break the staff over your knee or against a solid surface, performing a retributive strike. The staff is destroyed and releases its remaining magic in an explosion that expands to fill a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on it.You have a 50 percent chance to instantly travel to a random plane of existence, avoiding the explosion. If you fail to avoid the effect, you take force damage equal to 16 × the number of charges in the staff. Every other creature in the area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes an amount of damage based on how far away it is from the point of origin, as shown in the following table. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.Distance from OriginEffect10 ft. away or closer8 × the number of charges in the staff11 to 20 ft. away6 × the number of charges in the staff21 to 30 ft. away4 × the number of charges in the staff Animate Walking Statues. You can expend 1 or more of the staff's charges as an action to animate or deactivate one or more of the walking statues of Waterdeep. You must be in the city to use this property, and you can animate or deactivate one statue for each charge expended. An animated statue obeys the telepathic commands of Khelben Arunsun's spirit, which is trapped inside the staff (see Personality below). A walking statue becomes inanimate if deactivated or if the staff is broken. Dispel Magic. You can expend 1 of the staff's charges as a bonus action to cast dispel magic on a creature, an object, or a magical effect that you touch with the tip of the staff. If the target is an unwilling creature or an object in the possession of such a creature, you must hit the creature with a melee attack using the Blackstaff before you can expend the charge to cast the spell. Drain Magic. This property affects only creatures that use spell slots. When you hit such a creature with a melee attack using the Blackstaff, you can expend 1 of the staff's charges as a bonus action, causing the target to expend one spell slot of the highest spell level it can cast without casting a spell. If the target has already expended all its spell slots, nothing happens. Spell slots that are expended in this fashion are regained when the target finishes a long rest, as normal. Master of Enchantment. When you cast an enchantment spell of 1st level or higher while holding the staff, you can make an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC of 10 + the level of the spell. If the check succeeds, you cast the spell without expending a spell slot. Sentience. The Blackstaff is a sentient staff of neutral alignment, with an Intelligence of 22, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet, and it can communicate telepathically with any creature that is holding it. Personality. The staff has the spirits of all previous Blackstaffs trapped within it. Its creator, Khelben Arunsun, is the dominant personality among them. Like Khelben, the staff is extremely devious and manipulative. It prefers to counsel its owner without exerting outright control. The staff's primary goal is to protect Waterdeep and its Open Lord, currently Laeral Silverhand. Its secondary goal is to help its wielder become more powerful.In the event that the holder of the office of the Blackstaff no longer serves the staff's wishes, the staff ceases to function until it finds a worthy inheritor—someone whose loyalty to Waterdeep is beyond reproach. Spirit Trap. When the Blackstaff dies, the spirit of that individual becomes trapped in the staff along with the spirits of the previous Blackstaffs. (A Blackstaff whose spirit is trapped in the staff can't be raised from the dead.)Destroying the staff would release the spirits trapped inside it, but in that event, Khelben's spirit can lodge itself inside any one piece of the staff that remains. The piece containing Khelben's spirit has the staff's Sentience property but none of its other properties. As long as this piece of the staff exists, Khelben's spirit can make the staff whole again whenever he wishes. When the staff is remade, the spirits of the previous Blackstaffs become trapped inside it again. Versatile. This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.",

Immediately after you make a ranged attack with this weapon, it returns to your hand.Whenever you kill a humanoid with an attack using the Blade of Broken Mirrors, the blade remembers the creature's appearance.

Any equipment you are wearing or carrying isn't transformed. You can revert to your true appearance as an action. You revert to your true appearance automatically when you die.

In its dormant state, each of these artifacts has one minor beneficial property and one minor detrimental property. When the artifact attains an awakened state, it gains an additional minor beneficial property and an additional minor detrimental property. When the item reaches its exalted state, it gains a major beneficial property. See Artifact Properties in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for more information. Finesse. When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls. Light. A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons. Thrown. If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.",

Although he was very much alive, Kavan had some traits in common with vampires: he slept during the day and hunted at night, he drank the blood of his prey, and he lived underground. In battle, he wielded a spear stained with blood. His was the first blood spear, a weapon that drains life from those it kills and transfers that life to its wielder, imbuing that individual with the stamina to keep fighting.When you hit with a melee attack using this magic spear and reduce the target to 0 hit points, you gain 2d6 temporary hit points.Any creature can wield the spear, but only the character chosen by Kavan to wield it gains a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Thrown. If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon.

    "description": "The definitive treatise on all that is good in the multiverse, the fabled Book of Exalted Deeds figures prominently in many religions. Rather than being a scripture devoted to a particular faith, the book's various authors filled the pages with their own vision of true virtue, providing guidance for defeating evil.The Book of Exalted Deeds rarely lingers in one place. As soon as the book is read, it vanishes to some other corner of the multiverse where its moral guidance can bring light to a darkened world. Although attempts have been made to copy the work, efforts to do so fail to capture its magical nature or translate the benefits it offers to those pure of heart and firm of purpose.A heavy clasp, wrought to look like angel wings, keeps the book's contents secure. Only a creature of good alignment that is attuned to the book can release the clasp that holds it shut. Once the book is opened, the attuned creature must spend 80 hours reading and studying the book to digest its contents and gain its benefits. Other creatures that peruse the book's open pages can read the text but glean no deeper meaning and reap no benefits. An evil creature that tries to read from the book takes 24d6 radiant damage. This damage ignores resistance and immunity, and can't be reduced or avoided by any means. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this damage disappears in a blinding flash and is destroyed, leaving its possessions behind.Benefits granted by the Book of Exalted Deeds last only as long as you strive to do good. If you fail to perform at least one act of kindness or generosity within the span of 10 days, or if you willingly perform an evil act, you lose all the benefits granted by the book. Random Properties. The Book of Exalted Deeds has the following random properties:2 minor beneficial properties2 major beneficial properties Increased Wisdom. After you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book, your Wisdom score increases by 2, to a maximum of 24. You can't gain this benefit from the book more than once. Enlightened Magic. Once you've read and studied the book, any spell slot you expend to cast a cleric or paladin spell counts as a spell slot of one level higher. Halo. Once you've read and studied the book, you gain a protective halo. This halo sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. You can dismiss or manifest the halo as a bonus action. While present, the halo gives you advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to interact with good creatures and Charisma (Intimidation) checks made to interact with evil creatures. In addition, fiends and undead within the halo's bright light make attack rolls against you with disadvantage. Destroying the Book. It is rumored that the Book of Exalted Deeds can't be destroyed as long as good exists in the multiverse. However, drowning the book in the River Styx removes all writing and imagery from its pages and renders the book powerless for 1d100 years.",

    "sources": "DMG",
    "description": "The contents of this foul manuscript of ineffable wickedness are the meat and drink of those in evil's thrall. No mortal was meant to know the secrets it contains, knowledge so horrid that to even glimpse the scrawled pages invites madness.Most believe the lich-god Vecna authored the Book of Vile Darkness. He recorded in its pages every diseased idea, every unhinged thought, and every example of blackest magic he came across or devised. Vecna covered every vile topic he could, making the book a gruesome catalog of all mortal wrongs.Other practitioners of evil have held the book and added their own input to its catalog of vile knowledge. Their additions are clear, for the writers of later works stitched whatever they were writing into the tome or, in some cases, made notations and additions to existing text. There are places where pages are missing, torn. or covered so completely with ink, blood, and scratches that the original text can't be divined.Nature can't abide the book's presence. Ordinary plants wither in its presence, animals are unwilling to approach it, and the book gradually destroys whatever it touches. Even stone cracks and turns to powder if the book rests on it long enough.A creature attuned to the book must spend 80 hours reading and studying it to digest its contents and reap its benefits. The creature can then freely modify the book's contents, provided that those modifications advance evil and expand the lore already contained within.Whenever a non-evil creature attunes to the Book of Vile Darkness, that creature must make a DC 17 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's alignment changes to neutral evil.The Book of Vile Darkness remains with you only as long as you strive to work evil in the world. If you fail to perform at least one evil act within the span of 10 days, or if you willingly perform a good act, the book disappears. If you die while attuned to the book, an entity of great evil claims your soul. You can't be restored to life by any means while your soul remains imprisoned. Random Properties. The Book of Vile Darkness has the following random properties:3 minor beneficial properties1 major beneficial property3 minor detrimental properties2 major detrimental properties Adjusted Ability Scores. After you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book, one ability score of your choice increases by 2, to a maximum of 24. Another ability score of your choice decreases by 2, to a minimum of 3. The book can't adjust your ability scores again. Mark of Darkness. After you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book, you acquire a physical disfigurement as a hideous sign of your devotion to vile darkness. An evil rune might appear on your face, your eyes might become glossy black, or horns might sprout from your forehead. Or you might become wizened and hideous, lose all facial features, gain a forked tongue, or some other feature the DM chooses. The mark of darkness grants you advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to interact with evil creatures and Charisma (Intimidation) checks made to interact with non-evil creatures. Command Evil. While you are attuned to the book and holding it, you can use an action to cast the dominate monster spell on an evil target (save DC 18). You can't use this property again until the next dawn. Dark Lore. You can reference the Book of Vile Darkness whenever you make an Intelligence check to recall information about some aspect of evil, such as lore about demons. When you do so, double your proficiency bonus on that check. Dark Speech. While you carry the Book of Vile Darkness and are attuned to it, you can use an action to recite word from its pages in a foul language known as Dark Speech. Each time you do so, you take 1d12 psychic damage, and each non-evil creature within 15 feet of you takes 3d6 psychic damage. Destroying the Book. The Book of Vile Darkness allows pages to be torn from it, but any evil lore contained on those pages finds its way back into the book eventually, usually when a new author adds pages to the tome.If a solar tears the book in two, the book is destroyed for 1d100 years, after which it reforms in some dark corner of the multiverse.A creature attuned to the book for one hundred years can unearth a phrase hidden in the original text that, when translated to Celestial and spoken aloud, destroys both the speaker and the book in a blinding flash of radiance. However, as long as evil exists in the multiverse, the book reforms 1d10 × 100 years later.If all evil in the multiverse is wiped out, the book turns to dust and is forever destroyed.",

Its interior is divided into two floors. with a ladder running along one wall to connect them. The ladder ends at a trapdoor leading to the roof. When activated, the tower has a small door on the side facing you. The door opens only at your command, which you can speak as a bonus action. It is immune to the knock spell and similar magic, such as that of a chime of opening.Each creature in the area where the fortress appears must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d10 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In either case, the creature is pushed to an unoccupied space outside but next to the fortress. Objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried take this damage and are pushed automatically.The tower is made of adamantine, and its magic prevents it from being tipped over. The roof, the door, and the walls each have 100 hit points, immunity to damage from nonmagical weapons excluding siege weapons, and resistance to all other damage. Only a wish spell can repair the fortress (this use of the spell counts as replicating a spell of 8th level or lower). Each casting of wish causes the roof, the door, or one wall to regain 50 hit points.",

Your soul is drawn from your body and held within machinery in either the control room of the Monastery of the Distressed Body (area M8) or Kwalish's lab in Daoine Gloine (area O7), whichever comes later in the adventure. While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is incapacitated. Divination, contact other plane, or a similar spell of 4th level or higher reveals the location of the machinery that holds your soul. You draw no more cards.Using the Deck of Several ThingsThe special nature of this deck (carried by Mary Greymalkin if she is used as an NPC) means that many of its effects operate only within and with respect to this specific adventure. This typically covers any time the characters spend between setting out for the Barrier Peaks and the resolution of whatever events transpire in Kwalish's lab (area O7).For cards that effectively remove a character from play for a period of time (Donjon and the Void), you can allow a player to take on the role of one of the party's NPC hirelings, or introduce a temporary character as an NPC met during the party's journey. Alternatively, you can decide that only some aspect of the character's will disappears and is imprisoned, leaving the character to operate in a robotic state until freed.",

    "description": "The Draakhorn was a gift from Tiamat in the war between dragons and giants. It was once the horn of her ancient red dragon consort, Ephelomon, that she gave to dragonkind to help them in their war against the giants. The Draakhorn is a signaling device, and it is so large that it requires two Medium creatures (or one Large or larger) to hold it while a third creature sounds it, making the earth resonate to its call. The horn has been blasted with fire into a dark ebony hue and is wrapped in bands of bronze with draconic runes that glow with purple eldritch fire.The low, moaning drone of the Draakhorn discomfits normal animals within a few miles, and it alerts all dragons within two thousand miles to rise and be wary, for great danger is at hand. Coded blasts were once used to signal specific messages. Knowledge of those codes has been lost to the ages.Those with knowledge of the Draakhorn's history know that it was first built to signal danger to chromatic dragons—a purpose the Cult of the Dragon has corrupted to call chromatic dragons to the Well of Dragons from across the North.Within 50 feet of any enclosed space where the horn is blown, the air begins to shimmer from the sound. Any character within 20 feet of the entry to the enclosed space must succeed on a DC 12 Strength check to continue pushing against the pressure of the sound. A failure indicates the character can advance no farther toward the entry.For any character entering the enclosed space, the sound fades to silence—because any creature that enters the enclosed space is temporarily deafened and must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. Success indicates the deafness ends 2 minutes after the Draakhorn ceases to sound. Failure indicates the character remains deafened for 1 hour after the Draakhorn ceases to sound.While the horn is sounding, a creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw the first time on a turn the creature enters a 150-foot cone in front of the horn or starts its turn there. On a failed save, the creature takes 27 (6d8) thunder damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and isn't knocked prone.",

This divine weapon includes a shortbow and a quiver with four arrows, each tied to one of the four seasons. You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this bow, and you suffer no disadvantage when attacking at the weapon's long range.

The bow has 1 randomly determined major beneficial property.If you aren't a worshiper of Nylea, the bow has 1 randomly determined major detrimental property.See Artifacts in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for details on randomly determined properties. Arrows of the Seasons. The four arrows—each associated with a season—that accompany this bow can be fired only from it. Each arrow disappears immediately after it's used, and it reappears in the quiver at the next dusk. The save DC against spells cast with the arrows is 18. Each arrow has a unique property: Spring. As an action, you can fire this arrow, targeting a beast or a plant creature you can see within 320 feet of you. On a hit, the arrow deals no damage, and the target gains the benefits of the awaken spell for 8 hours. Summer. As an action, you can fire this arrow at an unoccupied space on the ground that you can see within 320 feet of you, no attack roll required. A Nyxborn lynx is summoned in that space (use the stat block for a tiger with the Nyxborn traits from chapter 6).

The bow can't be destroyed without first destroying all its arrows. The winter arrow must be fed to a cerberus on the winter solstice. The spring arrow must be planted at the base of a Black Oak of Asphodel on the spring equinox. The summer arrow must be broken by a sea giant on the summer solstice.

You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack.

At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way. Two-Handed. This weapon requires two hands to use.

Through dark magic and conquest, he forged a terrible empire. For all his power, Vecna couldn't escape his own mortality. He began to fear death and take steps to prevent his end from ever coming about.Orcus, the demon prince of undeath, taught Vecna a ritual that would allow him to live on as a lich. Beyond death, he became the greatest of all liches. Even though his body gradually withered and decayed, Vecna continued to expand his evil dominion. So formidable and hideous was his temper that his subjects feared to speak his name. He was the Whispered One, the Master of the Spider Throne, the Undying King, and the Lord of the Rotted Tower.Some say that Vecna's lieutenant Kas coveted the Spider Throne for himself, or that the sword his lord made for him seduced him into rebellion. Whatever the reason, Kas brought the Undying King's rule to an end in a terrible battle that left Vecna's tower a heap of ash. Of Vecna, all that remained were one hand and one eye, grisly artifacts that still seek to work the Whispered One's will in the world.The Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna might be found together or separately. The eye looks like a bloodshot organ torn free from the socket. The hand is a mummified and shriveled left extremity.To attune to the eye, you must gouge out your own eye and press the artifact into the empty socket. The eye grafts itself to your head and remains there until you die. Once in place, the eye transforms into a golden eye with a slit for a pupil, much like that of a cat. If the eye is ever removed, you die.To attune to the hand, you must lop off your left hand at the wrist and the press the artifact against the stump. The hand grafts itself to your arm and becomes a functioning appendage. If the hand is ever removed, you die. Random Properties. The Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna each have the following random properties:1 minor beneficial property1 major beneficial property1 minor detrimental property Properties of the Eye. Your alignment changes to neutral evil, and you gain the following benefits:You have truesight.You can use an action to see as if you were wearing a ring of X-ray vision. You can end this effect as a bonus action.The eye has 8 charges. You can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: clairvoyance (2 charges), crown of madness (1 charge), disintegrate (4 charges), dominate monster (5 charges), or eyebite (4 charges). The eye regains 1d4 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. Each time you cast a spell from the eye, there is a 5 percent chance that Vecna tears your soul from your body, devours it, and then takes control of the body like a puppet. If that happens, you become an NPC under the DM's control. Properties of the Eye and Hand. If you are attuned to both the hand and eye, you gain the following additional benefits:You are immune to disease and poison.Using the eye's X-ray vision never causes you to suffer exhaustion.You experience premonitions of danger and, unless you are incapacitated, can't be surprised.If you start your turn with at least 1 hit point, you regain 1d10 hit points.If a creature has a skeleton, you can attempt to turn its bones to jelly with a touch of the Hand of Vecna. You can do so by using an action to make a melee attack against a creature you can reach, using your choice of your melee attack bonus for weapons or spells. On a hit, the target must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or drop to 0 hit points.You can use an action to cast wish. This property can't be used again until 30 days have passed. Destroying the Eye and Hand. If the Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna are both attached to the same creature, and that creature is slain by the Sword of Kas, both the eye and the hand burst into flame, turn to ash, and are destroyed forever. Any other attempt to destroy the eye or hand seems to work, but the artifact reappears in one of Vecna's many hidden vaults, where it waits to be rediscovered.",

Removing a horn requires an action, and the weapons disappear and the horns return when the goat reverts to figurine form. In addition, the goat radiates a 30-foot-radius aura of terror while you are riding it. Any creature hostile to you that starts its turn in the aura must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of the goat for 1 minute, or until the goat reverts to figurine form. The frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once it successfully saves against the effect, a creature is immune to the goat's aura for the next 24 hours. Once the figurine has been used, it can't be used again until 15 days have passed.",

Its evil makes beasts visibly uncomfortable while within 30 feet of it. The staff has 10 charges and regains 1d6 + 4 of its expended charges daily at dusk.If the staff is broken or burned to ashes, its wood releases a terrible, inhuman scream that can be heard out to a range of 300 feet. All blights that can hear the scream immediately wither and die. Vampiric Strike. The staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff. On a hit, it deals damage as a normal quarterstaff, and you can expend 1 charge to regain a number of hit points equal to the damage dealt by the weapon. Each time a charge is spent, red blood oozes from the staff's pores, and you must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be afflicted with short term madness (see Madness in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master's Guide). Blight Bane. While you are attuned to the staff, blights and other evil plant creatures don't regard you as hostile unless you harm them. Versatile. This weapon can be used with one or two hands.

Gurt's greataxe was buried in Morgur's Mound until it was unearthed and brought back to Waterdeep.

Through dark magic and conquest, he forged a terrible empire. For all his power, Vecna couldn't escape his own mortality. He began to fear death and take steps to prevent his end from ever coming about.Orcus, the demon prince of undeath, taught Vecna a ritual that would allow him to live on as a lich. Beyond death, he became the greatest of all liches. Even though his body gradually withered and decayed, Vecna continued to expand his evil dominion. So formidable and hideous was his temper that his subjects feared to speak his name. He was the Whispered One, the Master of the Spider Throne, the Undying King, and the Lord of the Rotted Tower.Some say that Vecna's lieutenant Kas coveted the Spider Throne for himself, or that the sword his lord made for him seduced him into rebellion. Whatever the reason, Kas brought the Undying King's rule to an end in a terrible battle that left Vecna's tower a heap of ash. Of Vecna, all that remained were one hand and one eye, grisly artifacts that still seek to work the Whispered One's will in the world.The Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna might be found together or separately. The eye looks like a bloodshot organ torn free from the socket. The hand is a mummified and shriveled left extremity.To attune to the eye, you must gouge out your own eye and press the artifact into the empty socket. The eye grafts itself to your head and remains there until you die. Once in place, the eye transforms into a golden eye with a slit for a pupil, much like that of a cat. If the eye is ever removed, you die.To attune to the hand, you must lop off your left hand at the wrist and the press the artifact against the stump. The hand grafts itself to your arm and becomes a functioning appendage. If the hand is ever removed, you die. Random Properties. The Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna each have the following random properties:1 minor beneficial property1 major beneficial property1 minor detrimental property Properties of the Hand. Your alignment changes to neutral evil, and you gain the following benefits:Your Strength score becomes 20, unless it is already 20 or higher.Any melee spell attack you make with the hand, and any melee weapon attack made with a weapon held by it, deals an extra 2d8 cold damage on a hit.The hand has 8 charges. You can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: finger of death (5 charges), sleep (1 charge), slow (2 charges), or teleport (3 charges). The hand regains 1d4 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. Each time you cast a spell from the hand, it casts the suggestion spell on you (save DC 18), demanding that you commit an evil act. The hand might have a specific act in mind or leave it up to you. Properties of the Eye and Hand. If you are attuned to both the hand and eye, you gain the following additional benefits:You are immune to disease and poison.Using the eye's X-ray vision never causes you to suffer exhaustion.You experience premonitions of danger and, unless you are incapacitated, can't be surprised.If you start your turn with at least 1 hit point, you regain 1d10 hit points.If a creature has a skeleton, you can attempt to turn its bones to jelly with a touch of the Hand of Vecna.

This envelope extends out from the edges of the hull in all directions for a distance equal in length to the vessel's beam, so that creatures aboard and near the ship can breathe normally in space. The temperature within the air envelope is 70 degrees Fahrenheit.When placed aboard a vessel weighing between 1 and 100 tons, the helm generates an artificial gravity field while the ship is in the void of space, so that creatures can walk on the ship's decks as they normally would.

If the haversack is destroyed, its contents are lost forever, although an artifact always turns up again somewhere. If the haversack is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, and the haversack must be put right before it can be used again.

Most of these boxes are made of infernal iron, though some are carved from bone or horn. Infernal puzzle boxes are used to safeguard diabolical contracts signed between devils and mortals, even after the terms of these contracts are fulfilled. An empty infernal puzzle box weighs 3 pounds regardless of the materials used to fashion it.When an object small enough to fit inside an infernal puzzle box is placed in it, the container magically seals shut around the object, and no magic can force the box open. The sealed box becomes immune to all damage as well. Every infernal puzzle box is constructed with a unique means of opening it. The trick to solving the puzzle is always mundane, never magical. Once a creature figures out the trick or sequence of steps needed to open a particular infernal puzzle box, that creature can open the box as an action, allowing access to the box's contents.A creature that spends 1 hour holding an infernal puzzle box while trying to open it can make a DC 30 Intelligence (Investigation) check. If the check succeeds, the creature figures out the trick or sequence of steps needed to open the box. If the check fails by 5 or more, the creature must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw, taking 42 (12d6) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.",

    "name": "Moonblade",
    "sources": "DMG",
    "description": "Of all the magic items created by the elves, one of the most prized and jealously guarded is a moon blade. In ancient times, nearly all elven noble houses claimed one such blade. Over the centuries, some blades have faded from the world, their magic lost as family lines have become extinct. Other blades have vanished with their bearers during great quests. Thus, only a few of these weapons remain.A moonblade passes down from parent to child. The sword chooses its bearer and remains bonded to that person for life. If the bearer dies, another heir can claim the blade. If no worthy heir exists, the sword lies dormant. It functions like a normal longsword until a worthy soul finds it and lays claim to its power.A moonblade serves only one master at a time. The attunement process requires a special ritual in the throne room of an elven regent or in a temple dedicated to the elven gods.A moonblade won't serve anyone it regards as craven, erratic, corrupt, or at odds with preserving and protecting elvenkind. If the blade rejects you, you make ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws with disadvantage for 24 hours. If the blade accepts you, you become attuned to it and a new rune appears on the blade. You remain attuned to the weapon until you die or the weapon is destroyed.A moonblade has one rune on its blade for each master it has served (typically 1d6 + 1). The first rune always grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Each rune beyond the first grants the moon blade an additional property. The DM chooses each property or determines it randomly on the Moon Blade Properties table.Moonblade Propertiesd100Property01-40Increase the bonus to attack and damage rolls by 1, to a maximum of +3. Reroll if the moonblade already has a +3 bonus.41-80The moonblade gains a randomly determined minor property (see Special Features DMG p143).81-82The moonblade gains the finesse property.83-84The moonblade gains the thrown property (range 20/60 feet).85-86The moonblade functions as a defender.87-90The moon blade scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.91-92When you hit with an attack using the moon blade, the attack deals an extra 1d6 slashing damage.93-94When you hit a creature of a specific type (such as dragon, fiend, or undead) with the moonblade, the target takes an extra 1d6 damage of one of these types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder.95-96You can use a bonus action to cause the moonblade to flash brightly. Each creature that can see you and is within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. This property can't be used again until you take a short rest while attuned to the weapon.97-98The moonblade functions as a ring of spell storing.99You can use an action to call forth an elfshadow, provided that you don't already have one serving you. The elfshadow appears in an unoccupied space within 120 feet of you. It uses the statistics for a shadow, except it is neutral, immune to effects that turn undead, and doesn't create new shadows. You control this creature, deciding how it acts and moves. It remains until it drops to 0 hit points or you dismiss it as an action.00The moonblade functions as a vorpal sword. Sentience. A moon blade is a sentient neutral good weapon with an Intelligence of 12, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 12. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.The weapon communicates by transmitting emotions, sending a tingling sensation through the wielder's hand when it wants to communicate something it has sensed. It can communicate more explicitly, through visions or dreams, when the wielder is either in a trance or asleep. Personality. Every moonblade seeks the advancement of elvenkind and elven ideals. Courage, loyalty, beauty, music, and life are all part of this purpose.The weapon is bonded to the family line it is meant to serve. Once it has bonded with an owner who shares its ideals, its loyalty is absolute.If a moon blade has a flaw, it is overconfidence. Once it has decided on an owner, it believes that only that person should wield it, even if the owner falls short of elven ideals. Versatile. This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.",

Bring Out Your Dead. Also at rank 2, you regain the use of your Read the Kill feature after you finish a short or long rest. Bead of Instant Karma. At rank 3, one of the beads on your occultant abacus channels the power of instant karma, turning the occultant abacus into a rare magic item. As a reaction, you can target one creature you can see that is about to attempt an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, either granting advantage or imposing disadvantage on the roll. The bead crumbles to dust when used, reappearing on your occultant abacus at the next dawn. Bead of Diverted Karma. At rank 4, one of the beads on your occultant abacus allows you to divert karma to where it's needed, turning the occultant abacus into a very rare magic item. While the bead is unused, you know automatically when any creature you can see is about to make an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw with disadvantage. When such a roll is made, you can use a reaction to grant a d10 to a different creature you can see. That creature can add the d10 to any ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes within the next minute. The bead crumbles to dust when used, reappearing on your occultant abacus at the next dawn. Correct the Balance. As a rank 4 occultant, you learn that sometimes the death of a creature has unintended consequences. Within seven days of a creature's death, you can use your occultant abacus to divine ways to reverse or mitigate events resulting from that death. As an action, make a DC 15 Intelligence (Religion) check. On a success, you learn the relevant information based on the nature of the creature and its place in the world.If you fail the check, this property of the occultant abacus can't be used again until the next dawn. If you succeed on the check, this property can't be used again until dawn seven days later.",

    "name": "Orb of Dragonkind",
    "sources": "DMG",
    "description": "Ages past, on the world of Krynn, elves and humans waged a terrible war against evil dragons. When the world seemed doomed, the wizards of the Towers of High Sorcery came together and worked their greatest magic, forging five Orbs of Dragonkind (or Dragon Orbs) to help them defeat the dragons. One orb was taken to each of the five towers, and there they were used to speed the war toward a victorious end. The wizards used the orbs to lure dragons to them, then destroyed the dragons with powerful magic.As the Towers of High Sorcery fell in later ages, the orbs were destroyed or faded into legend, and only three are thought to survive. Their magic has been warped and twisted over the centuries, so although their primary purpose of calling dragons still functions, they also allow some measure of control over dragons.Each orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a presence that resents any attempt to coax magic from it. Those lacking in force of personality might find themselves enslaved to an orb.An orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside it.While attuned to an orb, you can use an action to peer into the orb's depths and speak its command word. You must then make a DC 15 Charisma check. On a successful check, you control the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it. On a failed check, you become charmed by the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it.While you are charmed by the orb, you can't voluntarily end your attunement to it, and the orb casts suggestion on you at will (save DC 18), urging you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The dragon essence within the orb might want many things: the annihilation of a particular people, freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the world, to advance the worship of Takhisis (Tiamat's name on Krynn), or something else the DM decides. Random Properties. An Orb of Dragon kind has the following random properties:2 minor beneficial properties1 minor detrimental property1 major detrimental property Spells. The orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you control the orb, you can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: cure wounds (5th-level version, 3 charges), daylight (1 charge), death ward (2 charges), or scrying (3 charges). You can also use an action to cast the detect magic spell from the orb without using any charges. Call Dragons. While you control the orb, you can use an action to cause the artifact to issue a telepathic call that extends in all directions for 40 miles. Evil dragons in range feel compelled to come to the orb as soon as possible by the most direct route. Dragon deities such as Tiamat are unaffected by this call. Dragons drawn to the orb might be hostile toward you for compelling them against their will. Once you have used this property, it can't be used again for 1 hour. Destroying an Orb. An Orb of Dragonkind appears fragile but is impervious to most damage, including the attacks and breath weapons of dragons. A disintegrate spell or one good hit from a +3 magic weapon is sufficient to destroy an orb, however.",

It communicates by transmitting emotions to its wielder, although on rare occasions it uses a limited form of telepathy to bring to the wielder's mind a couplet or stanza of ancient Dwarvish verse. Personality. Orcsplitter is grim, taciturn, and inflexible. It knows little more than the desire to face orcs in battle and serve a courageous, just wielder. It disdains cowards and any form of duplicity, deception, or disloyalty. The weapon's purpose is to defend dwarves and to serve as a symbol of dwarven resolve. It hates the traditional foes of dwarves—giants, goblins, and, most of all, orcs—and silently urges its possessor to meet such creatures in battle. Heavy. Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively. Two-Handed. This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.",

    "description": "This delicate and exquisitely crafted clockwork orrery features multiple geared components whose sweeping hands and dials represent the complex interplay of planar and magical realms. Standing two feet high, the orrery housing is a wondrous device imbued with magic of its own, but the power of its six clockwork components makes the artifact even more potent.The Orrery of the Wanderer was created by a renowned clockwork mage known only as Lottie. She crafted the relic as a means of tapping into the power of the planes, and to channel the divination and foretelling powers of the stars. But Lottie soon realized that her creation was far more powerful than she had intended. As it tapped into planar magic, the orrery began to manifest the darkness and malevolence inherent to some of the planes. Eventually, it would impress upon its owner a desire to open portals into the most cursed and dangerous worlds, including the Far Realm.To prevent the orrery from ever being so used, Lottie scattered the components that powered it, secreting them across the world. But the orrery's instinct for survival is strong, and its components have a way of inexorably coming together over decades or centuries, found by treasure hunters, stolen by monsters, found and stolen again—and moving closer to each other all the time.Random Properties. The orrery has the following randomly determined properties:2 minor beneficial properties1 major beneficial property1 major detrimental propertiesThe random properties of the orrery might function only when all its components are installed, or might function sporadically if any components are missing. The Sum of Its Parts. Each of the six components that powers the Orrery of the Wanderer is a powerful magic relic in its own right:The chronolometerThe dimensional loopThe far gearThe rotor of returnThe timepiece of travelThe wheel of starsCreatures can attune to the orrery's components individually. If attuned to an individual component, a creature must hold the component to make use of its features. A creature can also attune to the orrery and all the components installed in it. Attuning to an installed component doesn't count against the number of magic items you can normally attune to.While a component is not installed in the orrery, its magic might function sporadically or with unpredictable side effects, as determined by the DM. Future Echoes. With or without its components, the orrery lets you catch momentary glimpses of the future that warn you of danger. As long as the orrery is within 30 feet of you, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. Into the Void. With or without its components, the attuned orrery infuses your spirit with the tumultuous energy of the planes. Over time, your alignment changes to chaotic neutral, and you are compelled to engage with and explore the most dangerous planar realms. Master of Travel. While all six components of the Orrery of the Wanderer are installed, the artifact has 7 charges. While touching the orrery, you can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 17): contact other plane (3 charges), demiplane (6 charges), gate (7 charges), plane shift (5 charges), or teleportation circle (3 charges). The orrery regains 1d4 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn.",

On a successful check, the creature forces its way out and appears within 5 feet of the portable hole or the creature carrying it. A breathing creature within a closed portable hole can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.Placing a portable hole inside an extradimensional space created by a bag of holding, Heward's handy haversack, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane.

    "description": "Powered armor resembles a suit of unusual plate armor, with finely articulated joints connected by an oily, black, leather-like material. The armor has been worked to create the appearance of a heavily muscled warrior, and its great helm is unusual in that it has no openings—only a broad glass plate in the front with a second piece of glass above it. Strange plates, tubing, and large metal bosses adorn the armor in seemingly random fashion. On the back of the armor's left gauntlet is a rectangular metal box, from which projects a short rod tipped with a cone-shaped red crystal.While wearing this armor, you gain the following benefits:You have a +1 bonus to AC.Your Strength score is 18 (this has no effect if your Strength is already 18 or higher).You have advantage on death saving throws.The armor has further capabilities that can be powered either by energy cells or by your own life energy. You can use a bonus action to draw power from an energy cell or sacrifice hit points to gain one of the following benefits:Emit a force field to gain 2d6 + 5 temporary hit points (1 charge or 5 hit points).Activate boosters to gain a flying speed of 15 feet for 1 minute (1 charge or 5 hit points).Fire arm-mounted laser: Ranged Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, range 120 feet, one target. Hit: 2d6 radiant damage (1 charge or 5 hit points).Translate any writing you can see in any nonmagical language, to a total of one thousand words over 1 minute (1 charge or 5 hit points).Fill the armor with air, allowing you to breathe normally in any environment for up to 1 hour (1 charge or 5 hit points).Gain darkvision to a range of 60 feet for up to 1 hour (1 charge or 5 hit points).The armor can accept only one energy cell at a time. It is found with one energy cell attached, containing 2d10 charges.Powered Armor OptionsDepending on where and how it appears in the adventure, you might wish to modify the features of Kwalish's legendary powered armor. Automatic Defenses. Unless Kwalish deactivates the suit's automatic defenses, no one can approach the armor without setting those defenses off. Treat the armor as a shield guardian that has stored a magic missile spell cast using a 4th-level spell slot. When the armor is reduced to 0 hit points, its defenses are rendered inert and it can be safely approached. Battle of Wills. When donned by a new user, the armor deems itself superior and attempts to take possession of that user. The user must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or be possessed by the armor. While possessed, the user is incapacitated and loses control of its body but retains its awareness. The armor uses the possessed user's statistics (as adjusted by the armor), but doesn't gain access to the user's knowledge, features, or proficiencies.Freeing a creature trapped inside the armor first requires defeating the armor's automatic defenses (as above). The trapped creature can also attempt a DC 20 Charisma saving throw each day at dawn. On a successful save, the armor no longer controls the creature and can be safely donned by that creature at any time. Stasis. Whenever a creature wearing the armor drops to 0 hit points, the armor places that creature into a state of stasis. While in this state, the creature is stable and does not make death saving throws, but the armor takes control of the creature (as above). Additionally, the armor attempts to assume the identity of the user, assuring their allies that nothing is amiss. Freeing the user first requires defeating the armor's automatic defenses (as above). A creature in stasis does not make Charisma saving throws to break the armor's control. Alternative Power. Powered armor originally required energy cells to fuel it, but was adapted by Kwalish to be fueled by the life energy of the creature wearing it. You might decide that the armor can also draw power from additional sources, or that energy cells can be recharged with the aid of a tinker, inventor, or artificer. It might also be possible for allies to connect to the armor through the use of magic that generates a conduit something like an astral silver cord. While so connected, a willing ally can give up hit points as a reaction to fuel the armor's abilities.",

    "name": "Ring of Winter",
    "sources": "ToA",
    "description": "Artus Cimber has kept this item in his possession for over a century. The Ring of Winter is a golden band that resizes to fit snugly on the finger of its wearer. A thin layer of frost coats the outside of the ring, which normal heat can't melt. The ring feels ice cold to the touch and initially numbs the hand that wears it, but this cold ceases to be felt by one who is attuned to this ring.The Ring of Winter is sentient and tries to take control of any creature that wears it (see Sentient Magic Items chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide). If it succeeds, the ring compels its wearer to cause undue harm to everyone and everything around it, in a cold-hearted attempt to incur the wrath of enemies and bring the wearer's doom. Sentience. The Ring of Winter is a sentient chaotic evil item with an Intelligence of 14, a Wisdom of 14, and a Charisma of 17. The ring communicates by transmitting emotion to the creature carrying or wielding it, and it has hearing and normal vision out to a range of 60 feet. The ring craves destruction, and it likes inflicting indiscriminate harm on others. Nondetection. The Ring of Winter defies attempts to magically locate it. Neither the ring nor its wearer can be targeted by any divination magic or perceived through magical scrying sensors. Frozen Time. As long as you wear the ring, you don't age naturally. This effect is similar to suspended animation, in that your age doesn't catch up to you once the ring is removed. The ring doesn't protect its wearer from magical or supernatural aging effects, such as the Horrifying Visage of a ghost. Cold Immunity. While attuned to and wearing the ring, you have immunity to cold damage and don't suffer any ill effects from extreme cold (see chapter 5 of the Dungeon's Master Guide). Magic. The Ring of Winter has 12 charges and regains all its expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the ring, you can expend the necessary number of charges to activate one of the following properties:You can expend 1 charge as an action and use the ring to lower the temperature in a 120-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you can see within 300 feet of you. The temperature in that area drops 20 degrees per minute, to a minimum of -30 degrees Fahrenheit. Frost and ice begin to form on surfaces once the temperature drops below 32 degrees. This effect is permanent unless you use the ring to end it as an action, at which point the temperature in the area returns to normal at a rate of 10 degrees per minute.You can cast one of the following spells from the ring (spell save DC 17) by expending the necessary number of charges: Bigby's hand (2 charges; the hand is made of ice, is immune to cold damage, and deals bludgeoning damage instead of force damage as a clenched fist), cone of cold (2 charges), flesh to ice (3 charges; as flesh to stone except that the target turns to solid ice with the density and durability of stone), ice storm (2 charges), Otiluke's freezing sphere (3 charges), sleet storm (1 charge), spike growth (1 charge; the spikes are made of ice), or wall of ice (2 charges).You can expend the necessary number of charges as an action and use the ring to create either an inanimate ice object (2 charges) or an animated ice creature (4 charges). The ice object can't have any moving parts, must be able to fit inside a 10-foot cube, and has the density and durability of metal or stone (your choice). The ice creature must be modeled after a beast with a challenge rating of 2 or less. The ice creature has the same statistics as the beast it models, with the following changes: the creature is a construct with vulnerability to fire damage, immunity to cold and poison damage, and immunity to the following conditions: charmed, exhaustion, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, and poisoned. The ice creature obeys only its creator's commands. The ice object or creature appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of you. It melts into a pool of normal water after 24 hours or when it drops to 0 hit points. In extreme heat, it loses 5 (1d10) hit points per minute as it melts. Use the guidelines in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master's Guide to determine the hit points of an inanimate object if they become necessary. Other Properties. The Ring of Winter is rumored to possess other properties that can be activated only by an evil being whose will the ring can't break. Frost giants have long believed that the ring can be used to freeze entire worlds, while a djinni in the service of a Calishite pasha once claimed that the ring could be used to summon and control white dragons, as well as the mighty ice primordial named Cryonax. Destroying the Ring. The ring is nigh indestructible, resisting even the most intense magical heat. If it is placed on the finger of the powerful archfey known as the Summer Queen, the ring melts away and is destroyed forever.",

You can create spell slots only of a level equal to or lower than your own spell slots, up to a maximum of 5th level. You use the stored levels in place of your slots, but otherwise cast the spell as normal. For example, you can use 3 levels stored in the rod as a 3rd-level spell slot.A newly found rod has 1d10 levels of spell energy stored in it already.

It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.The weapon can speak, read, and understand Common, and can communicate with its wielder telepathically. Its voice is a rough, ruined echo. While you are attuned to it, Ruinblade also understands every language you know. Personality. Ruinblade speaks either with a dolorous or frenetic tone, depending on its mood. That mood improves when the sword is actively engaged in acts of destruction, but worsens if the blade is left inactive too long.The weapon's purpose is to ruin and unmake existing objects, so that its owner can rebuild the world from a blank slate. It thus encourages its wielder to engage in constant destruction, claiming that this will allow the creation of a more superior vision from the ruin of what came before. Heavy. Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively. Two-Handed.

She proved to be a charismatic proselytizer and, before the age of thirty, had gained a reputation for allowing no evil to stand before her.Markovia had long considered Strahd a mad tyrant, but only after his transformation into a vampire did she dare to challenge him.

It has AC 10, 10 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Crafting an amulet requires 1 week and costs 1,000 gp in components.A shield guardian's solitary focus is to protect the amulet's wearer. The amulet's wearer can command the guardian to attack its enemies or to guard the wielder against attack. If an attack threatens to injure the wearer, the construct can magically absorb the blow into its own body, even at a distance.A humanoid that attunes to this amulet knows the distance and direction of the shield guardian, provided the amulet and the guardian are on the same plane of existence. As an action, the amulet's attuned wearer can try to reactivate the shield guardian, doing so with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check. Reactivation can only be attempted while the amulet and guardian are within 10 feet of each other.",

Over time, Gargauth's evil has warped the shield's appearance, so that its celestial motif and designs have become twisted into a fiendish face that subtly moves in disturbing ways.While holding this shield, you gain a +2 bonus to AC and resistance to fire damage. Sentience. The Shield of the Hidden Lord is sentient as long as it imprisons Gargauth. While sentient, the shield has the following properties:The shield has an Intelligence of 22, a Wisdom of 18, and a Charisma of 24, as well as hearing and truesight out to a range of 120 feet.The shield can speak, read, and understand Common and Infernal, and it can communicate telepathically with any creature it can sense within 120 feet of it. Its voice is a deep, hollow whisper.The shield has 3 charges. You can use an action to expend 1 charge to cast fireball or 2 charges to cast wall of fire from the shield (save DC 21 for each). The wall of fire spell lasts for 1 minute (no concentration required). The shield regains all expended charges daily at dawn.Anytime during your turn, the shield can choose to radiate an aura of dread for 1 minute. (This is not a power of the shield that you control.) Any creature hostile to you that starts its turn within 20 feet of the shield must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is frightened until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this power of the shield for the next 24 hours. Once the shield uses this power, it can't use it again until the next dawn. Gargauth's Personality. Gargauth desperately seeks freedom but can't escape on its own. The pit fiend won't reveal its true nature, referring to itself only as the Hidden Lord. It drops hints and subtle suggestions that it is an angel trapped in an unholy prison. If released from the shield, the pit fiend honors the terms of whatever bargain it struck to facilitate its escape.While trapped in the shield, Gargauth carefully steers the shield's current owner toward committing acts of cruelty and domination, hoping to condemn the individual's soul to the Nine Hells. Conflict occurs if the shield's owner does anything that would make it more difficult for Gargauth to escape its prison, such as leaving the shield in a place where others are unlikely to find it.Gargauth doesn't know how to escape from the shield. The pit fiend believes (incorrectly) that it can break free of the shield if it's brought to the Nine Hells, for it's convinced that the shield's powers are weaker there. Freeing Gargauth. Casting dispel evil and good on the shield has a 1 percent chance of freeing the pit fiend, or automatically succeeds if the spell is cast by a solar, a planetar, or an archdevil. A god can release the pit fiend by touching the shield and speaking Gargauth's name. When released, Gargauth appears in a random, unoccupied space as close to the shield as possible.",

Each coin weighs one-third of a pound, and is inscribed with Infernal writing and a spell that magically binds a single soul to the coin. Because each soul coin has a unique soul trapped within it, each has a story. A creature might have been imprisoned as a result of defaulting on a deal, while another might be the victim of a night hag's curse. Carrying Soul Coins. To hold a soul coin is to feel the soul bound within it—overcome with rage or fraught with despair.An evil creature can carry as many soul coins as it wishes (up to its maximum weight allowance). A non-evil creature can carry a number of soul coins equal to or less than its Constitution modifier without penalty. A non-evil creature carrying a number of soul coins greater than its Constitution modifier has disadvantage on its attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. Using a Soul Coin. A soul coin has 3 charges. A creature carrying the coin can use its action to expend 1 charge from a soul coin and use it to do one of the following:Drain Life. You siphon away some of the soul's essence and gain 1d10 temporary hit points.Query. You telepathically ask the soul a question and receive a brief telepathic response, which you can understand. The soul knows only what it knew in life, but it must answer you truthfully and to the best of its ability. The answer is no more than a sentence or two and might be cryptic. Freeing a Soul. Casting a spell that removes a curse on a soul coin frees the soul trapped within it, as does expending all of the coin's charges. The coin itself rusts from within and is destroyed once the soul is released. A freed soul travels to the realm of the god it served or the outer plane most closely tied to its alignment (DM's choice). The souls of lawful evil creatures released from soul coins typically emerge from the River Styx as lemure devils.A soul can also be freed by destroying the coin that contains it. A soul coin has AC 19, 1 hit point for each charge it has remaining, and immunity to all damage except that which is dealt by a hellfire weapon or an infernal war machine's furnace (see Soul Fuel).Freeing a soul from a soul coin is considered a good act, even if the soul belongs to an evil creature. Hellish Currency. Soul coins are a currency of the Nine Hells and are highly valued by devils. The coins are used among the infernal hierarchy to barter for favors, bribe the unwilling, and reward the faithful for services rendered.Soul coins are created by Mammon and his greater devils on Minauros, the third layer of the Nine Hells, in a vast chamber where the captured souls of evil mortals are bound into the coins. These coins are then distributed throughout the Nine Hells to be used for goods and services, infernal deals, dark bargains, and bribes.",

    "description": "You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you throw it, its normal and long ranges both increase by 30 feet, and it deals one extra die of damage on a hit. After you throw it and it hits or misses, it flies back to your hand immediately. Curse. This weapon is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. Until the curse is broken with remove curse or similar magic, you are unwilling to part with the weapon, keeping it within reach at all times. In addition, you have disadvantage on attack rolls made with weapons other than this one.Whenever you roll a 1 on an attack roll using this weapon, the weapon bends or flies to hit you in the back. Make a new attack roll with advantage against your own AC. If the result is a hit, you take damage as if you had attacked yourself with the spear. Thrown. If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property. Versatile. This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.",

    "description": "This glass bottle can store one spell of up to 5th level at a time. When found, roll a d6 and subtract 1; the total determines the level of spell in the bottle (the DM chooses the spell, and 0 means the bottle is empty). A swirling blue vapor fills the bottle while it contains a spell.When the bottle is empty, any creature can cast a spell of 1st through 5th level into it by touching it while casting. The spell has no effect other than to be stored in the bottle.While holding the bottle, you can cast the spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The bottle becomes empty once the spell is cast.If you're holding the empty bottle when you see a creature casting a spell within 60 feet of you, you can open the bottle as a reaction in an attempt to interrupt the spell. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, the spell has no effect, and it is stored in the bottle. If it is casting a spell of 4th level or higher, make an Intelligence check. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a success, the spell has no effect, and it is stored in the bottle.",

Artifacts are the exception. Unless an artifact is susceptible to damage from a sphere of annihilation, it passes through the sphere unscathed. Anything else that touches the sphere but isn't wholly engulfed and obliterated by it takes 4d10 force damage.The sphere is stationary until someone controls it.

On a success, the sphere levitates in one direction of your choice, up to a number of feet equal to 5 × your Intelligence modifier (minimum 5 feet). On a failure, the sphere moves 10 feet toward you. A creature whose space the sphere enters must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be touched by it, taking 4d10 force damage.If you attempt to control a sphere that is under another creature's control, you make an Intelligence (Arcana) check contested by the other creature's Intelligence (Arcana) check. The winner of the contest gains control of the sphere and can levitate it as normal.If the sphere comes into contact with a planar portal, such as that created by the gate spell, or an extradimensional space, such as that within a portable hole, the DM determines randomly what happens, using the following table.d100Result01-50The sphere is destroyed.51-85The sphere moves through the portal or into the extradimensional space.86-00A spatial rift sends each creature and object within 180 feet of the sphere, including the sphere, to a random plane of existence.",

The Stone of Golorr has the following properties, determined by rolling on the tables in the Artifacts section in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide:1 minor beneficial property1 minor detrimental property Legend Lore. The Stone of Golorr has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the stone, you can expend 1 of its charges to cast the legend lore spell.By using the stone to cast legend lore, you communicate directly with the aboleth, and it shares its knowledge with you. The aboleth can't lie to you, but the information it provides is often cryptic or vague.The aboleth knows where Lord Neverember's secret vault is located. It also knows that three keys are needed to open the vault and that a gold dragon named Aurinax inhabits the vault and guards its treasures. Failed Memory. When your attunement to the Stone of Golorr ends, you must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, you lose all memory of the stone being in your possession and all knowledge imparted by it. A remove curse spell cast on you has a 20 percent chance of restoring the lost knowledge and memories, and a greater restoration spell does so automatically. Sentience. The Stone of Golorr is a sentient lawful evil magic item with an Intelligence of 18, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. It can communicate telepathically with the creature that is attuned to it, as long as that creature understands at least one language. In addition, the aboleth learns the greatest desires of any creature that communicates telepathically with the stone.The Stone of Golorr hungers for information and prefers not to remain in the clutches of any creature for too long. Whenever the stone desires a new owner, it demands to be given to another intelligent creature as quickly as possible. If its demands are ignored, it tries to take control of its owner (see Sentient Magic Items in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide). Personality. The Stone of Golorr has an alien intellect that is both domineering and hungry for knowledge. It thinks of itself as an ageless and immortal god. Destroying the Stone. While in stone form, the aboleth isn't a creature and isn't subject to effects that target creatures. The Stone of Golorr is immune to all damage. Casting an antipathy/sympathy spell on the stone destroys it if the antipathy effect is selected and the spell is directed to repel aberrations. When the spell is cast in this way, the stone transforms into mucus and is destroyed, and Golorr the aboleth appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of the stone's remains. The aboleth is incensed by the stone's destruction, and it attacks all other creatures it can see.",

    "description": "The Sunsword is a unique blade once possessed by Strahd's brother, Sergei von Zarovich. In its original form, it had a platinum hilt and guard, and a thin crystal blade as strong as steel.Strahd employed a powerful wizard named Khazan to destroy the weapon after Sergei's death. The first part of the process required the hilt and the blade to be separated, which Khazan accomplished. While Khazan was busying himself destroying the blade, his apprentice stole the hilt and fled. Khazan later located his apprentice's mutilated corpse in the Svalich Woods, but the hilt was nowhere to be found. To avoid the vampire's wrath, Khazan told Strahd that the entire weapon had been destroyed.The hilt, which is sentient, knows that it can never be reunited with its original crystal blade. It has, however, gained the properties of a sun blade. Sentience. The Sunsword is a sentient chaotic good weapon with an Intelligence of 11, a Wisdom of 17, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and normal vision out to a range of 60 feet. The weapon communicates by transmitting emotions to the creature carrying it or wielding it. Personality.

    "sources": "DMG",
    "description": "When Vecna grew in power, he appointed an evil and ruthless lieutenant, Kas the Bloody Handed, to act as his bodyguard and right hand. This despicable villain served as advisor, warlord, and assassin. His successes earned him Vecna's admiration and a reward: a sword with as dark a pedigree as the man who would wield it.For a long time, Kas faithfully served the lich but as Kas's power grew, so did his hubris. His sword urged him to supplant Vecna, so that they could rule the lich's empire in Vecna's stead. Legend says Vecna's destruction came at Kas's hand, but Vecna also wrought his rebellious lieutenant's doom, leaving only Kas's sword behind. The world was made brighter thereby.The Sword of Kas is a magic, sentient longsword that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. It scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20, and deals an extra 2d10 slashing damage to undead.If the sword isn't bathed in blood within 1 minute of being drawn from its scabbard, its wielder must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, the wielder takes 3d6 psychic damage. On a failed save, the wielder is dominated by the sword, as if by the dominate monster spell, and the sword demands that it be bathed in blood. The spell effect ends when the sword's demand is met. Random Properties. The Sword of Kas has the following random properties:1 minor beneficial property1 major beneficial property1 minor detrimental property1 major detrimental property Spirit of Kas. While the sword is on your person, you add a d10 to your initiative at the start of every combat. In addition, when you use an action to attack with the sword, you can transfer some or all of its attack bonus to your Armor Class instead. The adjusted bonuses remain in effect until the start of your next turn. Spells. While the sword is on your person, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells (save 18) from it: call lightning, divine word, or finger of death. Once you use the sword to cast a spell, you can't cast that spell again from it until the next dawn. Sentience. The Sword of Kas is a sentient chaotic evil weapon with an Intelligence of 15, a Wisdom of 13, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common Personality. The sword's purpose is to bring ruin to Vecna. Killing Vecna's worshipers, destroying the lich's works, and foiling his machinations all help to fulfill this goal.The Sword of Kas also seeks to destroy anyone corrupted by the Eye and Hand of Vecna. The sword's obsession with those artifacts eventually becomes a fixation for its wielder. Destroying the Sword. A creature attuned to both the Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna can use the wish property of those combined artifacts to unmake the Sword of Kas. The creature must cast the wish spell and make a Charisma check contested by the Charisma check of the sword. The sword must be within 30 feet of the creature, or the spell fails. If the sword wins the contest, nothing happens, and the wish spell is wasted. If the sword loses the contest, it is destroyed. Versatile. This weapon can be used with one or two hands.

Holy Light. The sword sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet. Fiends find the sword's light disconcerting and painful, even if they can't see it, and have disadvantage on attack rolls made within the weapon's radius of bright light.As a bonus action, you can intensify the sword's light, causing it to shed bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet, or reduce its glow to its normal intensity. Random Properties. The sword has 2 minor beneficial properties. Searing Radiance. The sword deals an extra 9 (2d8) radiant damage to any creature it hits, or 16 (3d10) radiant damage if you're wielding the weapon with two hands. An evil creature that takes this radiant damage must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of its next turn. Sentience. The Sword of Zariel is a sentient, lawful good item with an Intelligence of 10, a Wisdom of 20, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and normal vision out to a range of 30 feet.The sword communicates by transmitting emotion to the creature carrying or wielding it. Truth Seer. While holding the sword, you gain advantage on all Wisdom (Insight) checks. Destroying the Sword. Zariel can destroy the sword simply by grasping it. She couldn't bring herself to do so when she was an angel, but as an archdevil she has no compunction about ridding the multiverse of the weapon. The sword is also destroyed if it's used to shatter the Companion (see Shattering the Companion), unless the blade is wielded by an angel of challenge rating 15 or higher, or a good-aligned cleric or paladin of at least 10th level.If Zariel is killed for good (that is, if she dies in the Nine Hells), the sword becomes no harder to destroy than a normal longsword. Versatile. This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.",

The sword's magical properties are suppressed until it is removed from Valdemar's skull.Evil creatures can't attune to Tearulai; any evil creature that tries to do so takes 20 psychic damage. The weapon's emerald blade can't be damaged or dulled, and the sword can't be teleported anywhere without its wielder while the two are attuned to one another. Spells. The sword has 6 charges and regains 1d4 + 2 expended charges daily at dawn. A creature attuned to the sword can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells from it without material components: fly (2 charges), polymorph (3 charges), or transport via plants (4 charges). Sentience. The sword has an Intelligence of 17, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 20. It has hearing and truesight out to a range of 120 feet. It communicates telepathically with its attuned wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common, Draconic, Elvish, and Sylvan. In addition, the sword can ascertain the true value of any gemstone brought within 5 feet of it. Personality. Tearulai admires great beauty, music, fine art, and poetry. Vain, the weapon strives to improve its appearance. It craves gemstones and seeks out better ones with which to adorn itself. Most of all, it longs to return to the forests around Myth Drannor, where it was created. If its wielder's goals run counter to its own, Tearulai attempts to take control of its wielder and escape Undermountain, whereupon it can use its transport via plants spell to return whence it came.When you attack an object with this magic sword and hit, maximize your weapon damage dice against the target.When you attack a creature with this weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, that target takes an extra 14 slashing damage. Then roll another d20. If you roll a 20, you lop off one of the target's limbs, with the effect of such loss determined by the DM. If the creature has no limb to sever, you lop off a portion of its body instead.Note: According to the SRD, it is an extra 4d6 slashing damage, although this is incorrect.In addition, you can speak the sword's command to cause the blade to shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. Speaking the command word again or sheathing the sword puts out the light. Versatile. This weapon can be used with one or two hands.

    "name": "The Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad",
    "sources": "IMR",
    "description": "This strange device was once thought to have been built by gods long forgotten and to have survived the eons since their passing, for it is incredibly ancient and crafted by means unlike anything known today. However, its true origins derive from a planar craft that crashed in the Barrier Peaks, for the Infernal Machine once functioned as this craft's central command console.Explorers who discovered the crash site removed the command console and brought it back to civilization, not understanding its true purpose or powers. In later years, the console came into the possession of Baron Lum. By experimenting with its many controls, he was able to achieve astounding and destructive magical effects in the building of his empire, and so the artifact came to be known as the Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad. Yet with Lum's eventual defeat, his great machine was destroyed.The Infernal Machine is a delicate, intricate, bulky, and heavy device, weighing some 5,500 pounds. It can be operated using a control panel containing sixty levers, forty dials, twenty switches, and a number of jeweled components. These controls generate all kinds of powers and effects, as noted below. Silver Wire. The Infernal Machine's great size makes it largely immobile. To make ongoing use of the machine (such as while adventuring), it can be connected to its attuned user by a silver wire, a supply of which can always be produced from the machine's inner workings. This silver wire shares the same general nature as the silvery cord of an astral projection spell, connecting to the body of the user and trailing behind them. When so attached, the wire becomes invisible, astral, and extends to virtually infinite length.As long as the wire remains intact, the attuned user can make full use of the Infernal Machine's powers, with their effects centered around the user. If the wire is cut—something that can happen only when an effect specifically states that it can cut an astral projection's silvery cord—the user suffers a sudden burst of feedback from the machine that kills them instantly.Any effect of the Infernal Machine that requires concentration can be concentrated on by a remote user. The Infernal Machine's effects have a spell save DC of 14 or the attuned user's spell save DC, whichever is higher. Summon Monster. When first used by Baron Lum, the Infernal Machine was known for its ability to unleash terrible monsters within the world. Specific combinations of its controls can still recreate the effects of various spells of the conjuration school, as follows:1/day: conjure animals, summon lesser demons1/7 days: conjure minor elementals, conjure woodland beings, summon greater demon1/month: conjure elemental, conjure fey Wish. The Infernal Machine has the ability to bend the nature of reality, with the proper combination of controls recreating the effect of a wish spell (including all side effects). Due to the complex nature of its programming, this feature can be used only once per month. Each time this effect is used, there is a cumulative 10 percent chance of the Infernal Machine malfunctioning, necessitating seven days' worth of repairs and reprogramming, as well as the expenditure of 500 gp in parts, before it can be used again. When these repairs are done, the cumulative chance of malfunction returns to 10 percent. Random Properties. There are far more possible combinations for the Infernal Machine's controls than can ever be known or matrixed—especially as the controls shift position and reset themselves over time. At the end of each long rest of the user attuned to it, the Infernal Machine generates 1d4 + 1 random beneficial properties and 1d4 + 1 detrimental properties. Roll for each of these properties on the Infernal Machine Properties table. To keep things interesting, the DM might roll secretly for detrimental properties, revealing those properties only during the course of play.Once set, these properties last until the end of the attuned user's next long rest.(Our thanks to the D&D community for their suggestions for the properties of the Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad!) Destroying the Machine. The Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad is self-repairing of anything short of catastrophic damage, and how it was disabled in Lum's time remains a mystery. It is rumored that if one specific combination of controls is set, the Infernal Machine will enter a repair mode, allowing unfettered access to its inner workings—and preventing it from restoring itself if it is attacked. Alternatively, other combinations of controls might cause the Infernal Machine to teleport its most critical components to some hiding place deep in space and time, rendering it inoperable until those components are found again.Infernal Machine Propertiesd100Beneficial PropertyDetrimental Property01You have a flying speed of 150 feet but lose all other movement.You are blinded.02You can cast the speak with animals spell at will, but can use it to speak with only one animal of your choice.All animals despise you.

The device, as evil as its creator, shares the demon lord's aims to snuff out the lives of all living things and bind the Material Plane in the stasis of undeath. Orcus allows the wand to slip from his grasp from time to time. When it does, it magically appears wherever its master senses an opportunity to achieve some fell goal.Made from bones as hard as iron, the wand is topped with a magically enlarged skull that once belonged to a human hero slain by Orcus. The wand can magically change in size to better conform to the grip of its user. Plants wither, drinks spoil, flesh rots, and vermin thrive in the wand's presence.Any creature besides Orcus that tries to attune to the wand must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the creature takes 10d6 necrotic damage. On a failed save, the creature dies and rises as a zombie.In the hands of one who is attuned to it, the wand can be wielded as a magic mace that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The wand deals an extra 2d12 necrotic damage on a hit. Random Properties. The Wand of Orcus has the following random properties:2 minor beneficial properties1 major beneficial property2 minor detrimental properties1 major detrimental propertyThe detrimental properties of the Wand of Orcus are suppressed while the wand is attuned to Orcus himself. Protection. You gain a +3 bonus to Armor Class while holding the wand. Spells. The wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action and expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: animate dead (1 charge), blight (2 charges), circle of death (3 charges), finger of death (3 charges), power word kill (4 charges), or speak with dead (1 charge). The wand regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn.While attuned to the wand, Orcus or a follower blessed by him can cast each of the wand's spells using 2 fewer charges (minimum of 0). Call Undead. While you are holding the wand, you can use an action to conjure skeleton and zombie, calling forth as many of them as you can divide 500 hit points among, each undead having average hit points. The undead magically rise up from the ground or otherwise form in unoccupied spaces within 300 feet of you and obey your commands until they are destroyed or until dawn of the next day, when they collapse into inanimate piles of bones and rotting corpses. Once you use this property of the wand, you can't use it again until the next dawn.While attuned to the wand, Orcus can summon any kind of undead, not just skeletons and zombies. The undead don't perish or disappear at dawn the following day, remaining until Orcus dismisses them. Sentience. The Wand of Orcus is a sentient, chaotic evil item with an Intelligence of 16, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.The wand communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Abyssal and Common. Personality. The wand's purpose is to help satisfy Orcus's desire to slay everything in the multiverse. The wand is cold, cruel, nihilistic, and bereft of humor. In order to further its master's goals, the wand feigns devotion to its current user and makes grandiose promises that it has no intention of fulfilling, such as vowing to help its user overthrow Orcus. Destroying the Wand. Destroying the Wand of Orcus requires that it be taken to the Positive Energy Plane by the ancient hero whose skull surmounts it. For this to happen, the long-lost hero must first be restored to life—no easy task, given the fact that Orcus has imprisoned the hero's soul and keeps it hidden and well guarded.Bathing the wand in positive energy causes it to crack and explode, but unless the above conditions are met, the wand instantly reforms on Orcus's layer of the Abyss.",

    "description": "Built by dwarven gods and entrusted to the rulers of Shanatar, an ancient dwarven empire. The Wyrmskull Throne was a symbol of dwarven power and pride for ages untold. The throne hovers a foot off the ground and is a massive thing made of polished obsidian with oversized feet—the impaled skulls of four ancient blue dragons. Runes glisten in the carved obsidian winking to life with blue energy when the throne's powers are activated.After the fall of Shanatar, the Wyrmskull Throne fell into the clutches of less honorable creatures. A band of adventurers wrested the throne from the aquatic elf tyrant Gantar Kraok and sold it to the storm giant Neri for a considerable fortune. Neri had the throne magically enlarged and gave it to her husband, King Hekaton, as a gift, along with one of the Ruling Scepters of Shanatar, which she had found in a wreck at the bottom of the Trackless Sea. Only a creature attuned to a Ruling Scepter and in possession of it can harness the powers of the Wyrmskull Throne, which has become the centerpiece of King Hekaton's throne room in the undersea citadel of Maelstrom. Fear of the throne's power has helped prevent evil giants from challenging or threatening Hekaton's leadership.Any creature not attuned to a Ruling Scepter who sits on the throne is paralyzed and encased in a magical force field. While encased, the creature can't be touched or moved from the throne. Touching a Ruling Scepter to the force field dispels the field, though the creature remains paralyzed until it is separated from the throne.Any creature seated on the throne can hear faint Whispers in Draconic—the whisperings of four blue dragons whose skulls adorn the throne. Although powerless, these spirits try to influence the decisions of the throne's master Properties of the Throne. The throne has 9 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. A creature that sits on the throne while attuned to a Ruling Sceptor in its possession can harness the throne's properties, which are as follows:The throne gains a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover and flies where the creature wills. This property doesn't expend any charges.Both the throne and the creature sitting on it can move through earth and stone without disturbing the material they move through. This property doesn't expend any charges.As an action, the creature can expend 1 charge to cast lightning bolt (spell save DC 19) from the throne. The spell is cast as though using a 9th-level spell slot and deals 49 (14d6) lightning damage. The bolt discharges from the mouth of one of the throne's blue dragon skulls.As an action, the creature can expend 2 charges to cast the globe of invulnerability spell from the throne. The globe encloses both the creature and the throne.As an action, the creature can expend 3 charges to create a spectral image of an ancient blue dragon that surrounds both it and the throne. The spectral dragon lasts for 1 minute. At the end of each of the creature's turns, the spectral dragon makes one bite attack and two claw attacks against targets of the creature's choice. These attacks have the same attack bonus, reach, and damage as an ancient blue dragon's bite and claw attacks. Destroying the Throne. The Wyrmskull Throne can be destroyed by breaking at least five Ruling Scepters of Shanatar simultaneously on it. This fact has never been recorded or sung of among the dwarves or any bards or storytellers, and it can't be discovered with an ability check. Characters who want to destroy the throne must go on a quest to learn the method for doing so. The throne's destruction triggers an explosion, as shards of obsidian fly out in all directions. Each creature and object within a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on the throne must succeed on a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, taking 70 (20d6) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.",

The globe draws magic from the Weave that can be harnessed for various purposes. For example, Netherese mages used mythallars to keep their cities aloft and empower their magic items. The bigger the mythallar, the more magic it can hold. The largest mythallars are 150 feet in diameter.The Ythryn mythallar is a relatively small device—a mere 50 feet in diameter. To attune to this mythallar, a creature must finish a short rest within 30 feet of it, meditating on the mythallar. Up to eight creatures can be attuned to it at one time; otherwise, the Ythryn mythallar follows the attunement rules in the Dungeon Master's Guide. If a ninth creature tries to attune to the mythallar, nothing happens.All creatures attuned to the Ythryn mythallar can sense when the device is being used. A creature attuned to the device can use any of its properties, but only if all other creatures attuned to the device agree to allow it. The Ythryn mythallar's properties are as follows:While you're on the same plane of existence as the Ythryn mythallar, you can use an action to cause it to fly in any direction you choose at a speed of 30 feet. All matter within 500 feet of the device moves with it. The Ythryn mythallar and all structures held aloft by it hover in place when not in motion.As an action, you can cause one magic item you are holding within 30 feet of the Ythryn mythallar to immediately regain all its expended charges or uses. A magic item recharged in this manner can't be recharged by the Ythryn mythallar again until after the item regains expended charges or uses on its own.You can use the Ythryn mythallar to cast the control weather spell without requiring any components and without the need for you to be outdoors. This casting of the spell has a 50-mile radius. For the duration of the spell's casting time, you must be within 30 feet of the Ythryn mythallar or the spell fails. Touching the Mythallar. Any creature that touches the globe of the mythallar must make a DC 22 Constitution saving throw, taking 180 (20d10 + 70) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Undead have disadvantage on this saving throw. Any object that touches the globe, other than an artifact or the mythallar's cradle, is disintegrated instantly (no save).",
