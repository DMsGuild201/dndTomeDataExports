Its burrowing produces no ripple or other sign of its presence and leaves no tunnel or hole unless the dragon chooses to do so; in that case, it creates a passageway 15 feet wide by 10 feet high.

The creature takes 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone and restrained (by fallen debris); damage is halved and the creature is not restrained if it makes a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. The creature is freed when it or an adjacent ally uses an action to make a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.\n\n- A ten foot-wide, ten foot-long crack opens in the cavern floor where the dragon wishes. Any creature occupying that space must make a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall 20 feet, taking 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (3d4) piercing damage from the jagged stones at the bottom.\n\n- The dragon summons a swarm of insects as if it had cast insect plague, filling a 20-foot radius sphere within 90 feet of the dragon. Creatures that are in the affected space or that enter it take 22 (4d10) piercing damage, or half damage with a successful DC 18 Constitution saving throw. The swarm lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round.\n\nRegional Effects: \nthe region containing a legendary cave dragon’s lair is warped by the dragon’s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n\n- Poisonous and odorless gases suddenly fill passages and caverns, and just as quickly disperse, within six miles of the dragon’s lair.\n\n- Flash flooding turns tunnels into death traps as tremors create fissures in the stone within six miles of the lair. On the surface, ponds drain away, and long-dry creek beds break their banks in flood.\n\n- Swarms of vermin within one mile of the lair increase in both size and number as they try to escape the dragon’s endless and undiscriminating hunger.\n\nif the dragon dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.\n\n",

If the target is Large or smaller, it is grappled (escape DC 17). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained and the ammut can’t bite another target.\n\nSwallow: \nThe ammut makes one bite attack against a Large or smaller target it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is also swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the target is blinded and restrained and it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the ammut. An ammut can only have one Medium or smaller creature swallowed at a time.\n\nIf the ammut takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from the swallowed creature, the ammut must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the creature, which falls prone in a space within 10 feet of the ammut. If the ammut dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 10 feet of movement, exiting prone.\n\nGhost Breath (1/Day): \nThe ammut inhales the tortured spirits of undead within 30 feet. Each undead creature of CR 1 and lower in the area is automatically destroyed. All other undead must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be incapacitated for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n\nAbsorb Spirit (1/Day): \nThe ammut attempts to absorb the spirit of a dead or undead creature in its belly. The creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be absorbed by the ammut. A creature absorbed this way is destroyed and can’t be reanimated, though it can be restored to life by powerful magic, such as a resurrection spell. The ammut regains hp equal to the absorbed creature’s hp maximum.\n\n",

Additionally, a creature that fails two or three of the saving throws is affected by a plane shift spell and sent to a random plane. If it is sent to the plane it currently occupies, it appears 5d100 miles away in a random direction.\n\nLegendary Resistance (3/Day): \nIf the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.\n\nVoid Dweller: \nVoid dragons dwell in the empty expanse between the stars, and do not require air, food, drink, or sleep. When flying between stars the void dragon magically glides on solar winds, making the immense journey through the void in an impossibly short time.\n\nVoid Dragon's Lair: \non initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to generate one of the following effects; the dragon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:\n\n- The dragon negates natural gravity within its lair (an area affected by its gravitic breath is unaffected). Creatures drift 10 feet away from the ground over the course of a round and are restrained. Flying creatures can move at half speed, unless they have the (hover) tag or use magical flight, in which case they move normally. This effect persists until initiative count 20 on the following round.\n\n- The Void briefly overlaps the dragon’s lair in a 20-foot-radius sphere of blackness punctuated by deep blue streaks and pinpoints of light. The sphere is centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of the dragon. The area spreads around corners, is heavily obscured, and contains no air (creatures must hold their breath). Each creature in the sphere when it appears must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) cold damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one. Any creature that ends its turn in the sphere takes 10 (3d6) cold damage. The sphere lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.\n\n- The dragon rips the fabric of space, forcing two creatures it can see within 120 feet of it to suddenly exist in the same place. Space itself repels the creatures to their original positions. Each creature takes 16 (3d10) force damage and is knocked prone, or takes half as much damage and is not knocked prone with a successful DC 15 Strength saving throw.\n\nRegional Effects: \nthe region containing a legendary void dragon’s lair is warped by the dragon’s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n\n- Secrets have a way of coming to light within 6 miles of the lair. Clues are inadvertently discovered, slips of the tongue hint at a hidden truth, and creatures become morbidly curious for forbidden knowledge.\n\n- Light is muted within 6 miles of the lair. Nonmagical illumination, including sunlight, can’t create bright light in this area.\n\n- Visitations from otherworldly beings occur and disembodied voices whisper in the night within 6 miles of the dragon’s lair. Celestials, fey, and fiends of CR 2 or lower can slip into the world in this area.\n\nif the dragon dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.\n\n",

Undead creatures automatically fail the saving throw and treat all damage dealt by this breath weapon as radiant instead of cold.\n\nChange Shape: \nThe ankou magically polymorphs into any beast, humanoid, or undead creature it has seen before that has a challenge rating no higher than its own, or back into its true form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the ankou’s choice). Its statistics, other than its size, are the same in each form and it doesn’t gain any class features or legendary actions of the new form.\n\nUsher of Souls: \nThe ankou can transport itself and up to eight creatures in contact with it to another plane of existence. This works like the plane shift spell, except dead or incorporeal creatures can be transported and don’t have to be willing. The ankou can’t use this ability to banish an unwilling creature.\n\n",

The effect lasts until the creature succeeds on the saving throw or until the Bear King uses this lair action again.- The Bear King causes the ground in a 20-foot radius to tremble and shake. Any creatures in the affected area must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or suffer 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage and fall prone. The ground continues to tremble until initiative count 20 on the following round, during which time the area is difficult terrain.\n\nRegional Effects: \nthe region surrounding Gloaming Crag is warped by the Bear King’s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:- Within 10 miles of the Bear King’s lair, creatures have disadvantage on saving throws made to avoid contracting lycanthropy from a werebear.- Bees within 10 miles of the Bear King’s lair are easily agitated quick to attack. Insect swarms (bees or hornets) are common in the area, but they tend to ignore locals.- Emotions within 5 miles of the Bear King’s lair run high. Arguments quickly descend into physical scuffles and enjoyable get-togethers are likely to become raucous carousing or even brawls.if the Bear King dies, conditions in the area surrounding the lair return to normal over the course of 1d6 days.\n\n",

Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 26 (4d12) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nDrown. The blood giant sends blood pouring down the throat of one creature within 30 feet, which must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature is incapacitated until the end of its next turn as it coughs up the blood and is poisoned for 1 minute after that.\nVaporize. A red mist surrounds the blood giant in a 20-foot-radius sphere. The mist spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. It moves with the blood giant and doesn’t impede the giant’s vision. The mist dissipates after 1d4 rounds.\n\n",

The chelicerae has the following wizard spells prepared:\n\ncantrips: acid splash, mage hand, minor illusion, true strike\n\n1st level: burning hands, detect magic, expeditious retreat, ray of sickness\n\n2nd level: hold person, invisibility, scorching ray\n\n3rd level: animate dead, haste, lightning bolt\n\n4th level: phantasmal killer\n\nSiphon Spell Slots: \nThe chelicerae cannot replenish its spells naturally. Instead, it uses grappled spellcasters as spell reservoirs, draining uncast spells to power its own casting. Whenever the chelicerae wishes to cast a spell, it consumes a number of spell slots from its victim equal to the spell slots necessary to cast the spell. If the victim has too few spell slots available, the chelicerae cannot cast that spell. The chelicerae can also draw power from drained spellcasters or creatures without magic ability. It can reduce a grappled creature's Wisdom by 1d4, adding 2 spell slots to its spell reservoir for every point lowered. A creature reduced to 0 Wisdom is unconscious until it regains at least one point, and can't offer any more power. A creature regains all lost Wisdom when it finishes a long rest.\n\nSpider Climb: \nChelicerae can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without requiring an ability check.\n\n",

The fetal savant can use this power at will, but it can exchange souls with only one other creature at a time. The victim resists the attack with a successful DC 13 Charisma saving throw. A creature that successfully saves is immune to the same fetal savant's soul exchange for 24 hours. If the saving throw fails, the fetal savant takes control of the target's body and ferociously attacks nearby opponents, eyes blazing with otherworldly light. As an action, the fetal savant can shift from its host body back to its own, if it is within range, returning the victim's soul to its own body. If the host body or fetal savant is brought to 0 hit points within 90 feet of each other, the two souls return to their original bodies and the creature at 0 hit points is dying; it must make death saving throws until it dies, stabilizes, or regains hit points, as usual. If the host body or fetal savant is slain while they are more than 90 feet apart, their souls cannot return to their bodies and they are both slain. While trapped in the fetal savant's withered body, the victim is effectively paralyzed and helpless.\n\n",

The cage (AC 19, 10 hp) is considered an equipped object when borne by a derro and cannot be attacked directly. In addition, the cage protects the occupant from up to 20 spell levels of spells 4th level or lower but provides no protection to those outside of the cage. Spells of level 5 or higher take full, normal effect against the cage and its occupant. Once the cage protects against 20 or more spell levels it is rendered non-magical.

The whirlwind lasts as long as the djinni maintains concentration (as if concentrating on a spell). Any creature but the djinni that enters the whirlwind must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be restrained by it. The djinni can move the whirlwind up to 60 feet as an action, and creatures restrained by the whirlwind move with it. The whirlwind ends if the djinni loses sight of it.\nA creature can use its action to free a creature restrained by the whirlwind, including itself, by succeeding on a DC 18 Strength check. If the check succeeds, the creature is no longer restrained and moves to the nearest space outside the whirlwind.\n\n",

        "monster_sAblt": "Elemental Demise: \nIf the djinni dies, its body disintegrates into a warm breeze, leaving behind only equipment the djinni was wearing or carrying.\n\nInnate Spellcasting: \nThe djinni's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 17, +9 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:\n\nAt will: detect evil and good, detect magic, thunderwave\n3/day each: create food and water (can create wine instead of water), tongues, wind walk\n1/day each: conjure elemental (air elemental only), creation, gaseous form, invisibility, major image, plane shift\n\nVariant: Genie Powers: \nGenies have a variety of magical capabilities, including spells. A few have even greater powers that allow them to alter their appearance or the nature of reality.\n\n**Disguises.** Some genies can veil themselves in illusion to pass as other similarly shaped creatures. Such genies can innately cast the disguise self spell at will, often with a longer duration than is normal for that spell. Mightier genies can cast the true polymorph spell one to three times per day, possibly with a longer duration than normal. Such genies can change only their own shape, but a rare few can use the spell on other creatures and objects as well.\n**Wishes.** The genie power to grant wishes is legendary among mortals. Only the most potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular genie that has this power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn't a genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can't grant wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1 year). and cosmic law dictates that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that creature's existence.\nTo be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the wish spell on the creature's behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie's nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish's poor wording. The perversion of the wording is usually crafted to be to the genie's benefit.\n\n",

Hit: 1 piercing damage.\n\nArcane Doubling (recharges after 10 minutes): \nA doppelrat under duress creates clones of itself at the beginning of its turn. Each round for 4 rounds, the number of live doppelrats quadruples but never exceeds 20. For example, when the doppelrat triggers arcane doubling, 1 rat becomes 4; at the start of the rat's next turn, those 4 become 16; and at the start of the rat's third turn, those 16 become 20, the maximum allowed. If one of the duplicates was destroyed between the original doppelrat's 1st and 2nd turns, then the surviving 3 would become 12, and so on. Each duplicate appears in the same space as any other rat, can either move or take an action the round it appears, and has 4 hit points and AC 13. Any surviving duplicates perish 1 minute (10 rounds) after the first ones were created. If the original doppelrat dies, its clones stop duplicating but the preexisting clones remain until their time expires. A creature can identify the original doppelrat from its duplicates as an action by making a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) or Wisdom (Perception) check.\n\nDoppeling Disease: \nAt the end of a dopplerat encounter, every creature bitten by a doppelrat or its duplicates must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or contract the degenerate cloning disease. During each long rest, the diseased creature grows and sloughs off a stillborn clone. The doppeling process leaves the diseased creature incapacitated for 1 hour, unable to move and barely able to speak (spellcasting is impossible in this state). When the incapacitation wears off, the creature makes a DC 12 Constitution saving throw; it recovers from the disease when it makes its second successful save. Humanoid clones created by the disease cannot be brought to life in any manner.\n\n",

It gets one extra reaction that be used only for opportunity attacks.\n\nInnate Spellcasting: \nThe dvarapala’s innate spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 14).

If used as a focus for Ring Magic, the spell does not require a spell slot one level higher than the spell normally requires. Once per day, the dwarven ringmage can imbue a spell of 4th level or lower into his ring-staff by expending a spell slot equal to the spell being imbued.\n\nSpellcasting: \nthe mage is a 9th-level spellcaster.

It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:\n\nAt will: detect magic\n3/day: enlarge/reduce, tongues\n1/day each: conjure elemental (fire elemental only), gaseous form, invisibility, major image, plane shift, wall of fire\n\nVariant: Genie Powers: \nGenies have a variety of magical capabilities, including spells. A few have even greater powers that allow them to alter their appearance or the nature of reality.\n\n**Disguises.** Some genies can veil themselves in illusion to pass as other similarly shaped creatures. Such genies can innately cast the disguise self spell at will, often with a longer duration than is normal for that spell. Mightier genies can cast the true polymorph spell one to three times per day, possibly with a longer duration than normal. Such genies can change only their own shape, but a rare few can use the spell on other creatures and objects as well.\n**Wishes.** The genie power to grant wishes is legendary among mortals. Only the most potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular genie that has this power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn't a genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can't grant wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1 year). and cosmic law dictates that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that creature's existence.\nTo be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the wish spell on the creature's behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie's nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish's poor wording. The perversion of the wording is usually crafted to be to the genie's benefit.\n\n",

To determine which spirit is in control, roll on the table below (it is possible for one spirit to remain in control for multiple rounds if it is rolled multiple rounds in a row):\n| 1d6 | Spirit |\n|-----|--------|\n| 1 | Cautious: creates space between itself and its enemies and casts spells. |\n| 2 | Fickle: attacks a creature it didn’t last round. |\n| 3 | Terrified: uses the Disengage action to run as far away from enemies as possible. |\n| 4 | Bloodthirsty: attacks the nearest creature. |\n| 5 | Hateful: only attacks the last creature it damaged. |\n| 6 | Courageous: makes melee attacks against the most threatening enemy. |\n\nRunic Spellcasting: \nThe runes etched on the elophar’s rotting skin allow it to cast spells. The elophar’s runic spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 13, +5 to hit with spell attacks). The elophar can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:\nAt will: acid splash, chill touch, poison spray\n3/day: grease, thunderwave\n1/day: enlarge/reduce\n\n",

The target creature must be within 25 feet of the emerald eye when attraction is triggered, but the creature is then free to move beyond this range while remaining under the effect.

        "monster_sAblt": "Legendary Resistance (3/day): \nIf the emperor fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.\n\nSpellcasting: \nthe emperor is a 17th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting attribute is Charisma (spell save DC 19, +11 to hit with spell attacks). The emperor knows the following sorcerer spells:\n\ncantrips (at will): blade ward, chill touch, message, prestidigitation, shocking grasp, true strike\n\n1st level (4 slots): magic missile, shield\n\n2nd level (3 slots): mirror image, phantasmal force\n\n3rd level (3 slots): fear, fireball\n\n4th level (3 slots): blight, dimension door\n\n5th level (2 slots): cloudkill, hold monster\n\n6th level (1 slot): circle of death\n\n7th level (1 slot): finger of death, teleport\n\n8th level (1 slot): power word stun\n\n9th level (1 slot): power word kill\n\nSunlight Sensitivity: \nWhile in direct sunlight, the emperor has disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.\n\nTurn Resistance: \nThe emperor has advantage on saving throws against effects that turn undead.\n\nEmperor Of The Ghouls' Lair Actions: \non initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the Emperor takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects. The Emperor can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:\n\n- Until initiative count 20 on the following round, all creatures other than undead and constructs who take necrotic damage take an additional 7 (2d6) necrotic damage.\n\n- The emperor targets a creature within 30 feet that he can see. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 18 (4d8) necrotic damage. The emperor regains hit points equal to the damage.\n\n- A wall of ice springs up from a surface within 100 feet of the emperor. The wall is 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick. A creature in the wall’s space when it appears must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) cold damage; then the creature is pushed to either side of the wall (the creature’s choice). Each 5-foot section of the wall has AC 10, 15 hit points, resistance to piercing and slashing damage, immunity to cold, poison, and psychic damage, and vulnerability to fire damage. The wall lasts until the emperor uses this action again, or dies.\n\nRegional Effects: \nthe region around the emperor’s lair is warped by its magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n\n- Creatures within 1 mile of the lair who are infected with darakhul fever have disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws against spells and effects generated by ghouls or darakhul.\n\n- Dead bodies within 1 mile of the lair have an 80 percent chance to reanimate as skeletons or zombies 24 hours after their death.

Its statistics are the same in each form, with the exception of its attacks in eagle form.\n\nEver Touching: \nFidele angels maintain awareness of their mate's disposition and health. Damage taken by one is split evenly between both, with the original target of the attack taking the extra point when damage doesn't divide evenly. Any other baneful effect, such as ability damage, affects both equally.\n\nInnate Spellcasting: \nthe angel's innate spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:\n\nat will: guidance, light, purify food and drink, spare the dying\n\n3/day: cure wounds, scorching ray (5 rays)\n\n1/day: bless, daylight, detect evil and good, enhance ability, hallow, protection from evil and good\n\nMagic Resistance: \nThe angel has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.\n\nMagic Weapons: \nThe angel's weapon attacks are magical while it is in eagle form.\n\nTo My Lover's Side: \nIf separated from its mate, each fidele angel can use both plane shift and teleport 1/day to reunite.\n\nUnshakeable Fidelity: \nFidele angels are never voluntarily without their partners. No magical effect or power can cause a fidele angel to act against its mate, and no charm or domination effect can cause them to leave their side or to change their feelings of love and loyalty toward each other.\n\n",

The charm lasts for 24 hours or until the fierstjerren is destroyed, is more than 300 feet from the charmed target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect.

A successful saving throw makes the creature immune to the darakhul's stench for 24 hours. A darakhul using this ability can't also benefit from Master of Disguise.\n\nSunlight Sensitivity: \nThe darakhul has disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight and on attack rolls while it, the object it is trying to see or attack in direct sunlight.\n\nTurning Defiance: \nThe darakhul and any ghouls within 30 feet of it have advantage on saving throws against effects that turn undead.\n\nDarakhul Fever: \nspread mainly through bite wounds, this rare disease makes itself known within 24 hours by swiftly debilitating the infected. A creature so afflicted must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw after every long rest. On a failed save the victim takes 14 (4d6) necrotic damage, and its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction can't be removed until the victim recovers from darakhul fever, and even then only by greater restoration or similar magic. The victim recovers from the disease by making successful saving throws on two consecutive days. Greater restoration cures the disease; lesser restoration allows the victim to make the daily Constitution check with advantage. Primarily spread among humanoids, the disease can affect ogres, and therefore other giants may be susceptible. If the infected creature dies while infected with darakhul fever, roll 1d20, add the character's current Constitution modifier, and find the result on the Adjustment Table to determine what undead form the victim's body rises in. Adjustment Table Roll Result:\n\n1-9 None; victim is simply dead\n\n10-16 Ghoul\n\n17-20 Ghast\n\n21+ Darakhul\n\n",

A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of whom are equals within the group. However, each of the hags continues to desire more personal power.\nA coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two hags can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict, the result is usually chaos.\n\nShared Spellcasting (Coven Only): \nWhile all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard's spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves:\n\n• 1st level (4 slots): identify, ray of sickness\n• 2nd level (3 slots): hold person, locate object\n• 3rd level (3 slots): bestow curse, counterspell, lightning bolt\n• 4th level (3 slots): phantasmal killer, polymorph\n• 5th level (2 slots): contact other plane, scrying\n• 6th level (1 slot): eye bite\n\nFor casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save DC is 12+the hag's Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack bonus is 4+the hag's Intelligence modifier.\n\nHag Eye (Coven Only): \nA hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.\nA hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.\n\n",

If the creature has something to pull on, it can pull itself out of the wind by using an action and making a successful DC 15 Strength check; another creature who can reach the suspended creature can pull it free in the same way. Alternatively, a flying creature can repeat the saving throw as an action. On a success, it moves 5 feet out of the pillar of wind. This effect lasts until Hraesvelgr takes this action again or dies.\n\n- Hraesvelgr lets out a thunderous bellow in giant form or an ear-splitting shriek in roc form. All creatures within 30 feet must make a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n\nRegional Effects: \nthe region containing Hraesvelgr’s lair is warped by the corpse swallower’s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n\n- Strong windstorms are common within 6 miles of the lair.\n\n- Giant avian beasts are drawn to the lair and fiercely defend it against intruders.\n\n- The wind within 10 miles of the lair bears a pungent carrion stench.\n\nif Hraesvelgr dies, conditions in the area surrounding the lair return to normal over the course of 1d10 days.\n\n",

Nearby creatures and objects are pushed to the nearest available space and must make a successful DC 15 Strength saving throw or fall prone. Weapons, armor, and other objects worn or carried by the hulking whelp grow (and shrink again) proportionally when it changes size. Overcome by raw emotion, it sets about destroying anything and everything it can see (which isn't much) and reach (which is quite a lot). The transformation lasts until the hulking whelp is unaware of any nearby creatures for 1 round, it drops to 0 hit points, it has 5 levels of exhaustion, or it's affected by a calm emotions spell or comparable magic. The transformation isn't entirely uncontrollable; people or creatures the whelp knows and trusts can be near it without triggering the reaction.

Inside the hidey-hole, a kikimora can see what is going on outside the space through a special sensor. This sensor functions like a window, and it can be blocked by mundane objects placed in front of the sigil. If she leaves an item in her space, it remains there even if she removes the sigil and places it in another location. If someone else removes the sigil, all contents are emptied into the Ethereal Plane (including any beings within her hidey-hole at the time).

The whirlwind is 10 feet wide and up to 50 feet tall. A creature in the area of the whirlwind when it’s created, or who enters the area for the first time on a turn, must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw.

The whirlwind lasts until Koschei uses this action again or dies.\n\n- Tortured spirits appear and attack up to three creatures Koschei can see within the lair. One attack is made against each targeted creature; each attack has +8 to hit and does 10 (3d6) necrotic damage.\n\n- Koschei disrupts the flow of magic in his lair.

They behave aggressively, but only attack if cornered. Foraging for food by hunting is difficult and only yields half the normal amount of food.\n\n- Wind and snowstorms are common within 5 miles of the lair.\n\n- Koschei is aware of any spell cast within 5 miles of his lair. He knows the source of the magic (innate, the caster’s class, or a magic item) and knows the direction to the caster.\n\nif Koschei dies, conditions in the area surrounding his lair return to normal over the course of 1d10 days.\n\n",

This spray forms a line 10 feet long and 5 feet wide. The first creature in the line must make a successful DC 24 Constitution saving throw against disease or be infected by Mechuiti's Ichor disease. The creature is poisoned until the disease is cured. Every 24 hours that elapse, the target must make a successful DC 24 Constitution saving throw or reduce its hit point maximum by 5 (2d4). The disease is cured on a success. The target dies if the disease reduces its hit point maximum to 0. This reduction to the target's hit point maximum lasts until the disease is cured.\n\nInnate Spellcasting: \nmechuiti's spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 22, +14 to hit with spell attacks). Mechuiti can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:\n\nat will: dispel magic, fireball, hold monster, wall of fire\n\n3/day each: fire storm, power word stun\n\n1/day each: meteor swarm, power word kill\n\nSpeak with Apes: \nMechuiti can communicate simple concepts to apes.\n\nMechuiti's Lair: \non initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Mechuiti takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects. Mechuiti can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row.\n\n- Mechuiti targets one creature it can see within 120 feet of it, and a fissure full of lava opens under the target’s feet. The target must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or take 28 (8d6) fire damage.\n\n- The whole volcano trembles and shakes. Each creature on a solid surface other than a demon must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone. All ground in the volcano becomes difficult terrain for creatures other than a demon until initiative count 20 on the next round.\n\n- Volcanic gases form a cloud in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point Mechuiti can see within 120 feet of it. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is lightly obscured. It lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round. Each creature that starts its turn in the cloud must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of its next turn. While poisoned in this way, a creature is incapacitated.\n\n- The pain of all creatures other than demons within 120 feet of Mechuiti is intensified. Until initiative count 20 on the next round, every time a creature affected this way takes damage, he must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of its next turn.\n\nRegional Effects: \nthe region containing Mechuiti’s lair is warped by its presence, which creates one or more of the following effects.\n\n- Mechuiti can make the volcano erupt at will. A cloud of hot ashes and smoke covers a 6 mile area around the volcano, and magma flows from the volcano’s cone.\n\n- When intelligent creatures within 6 miles sleep, they dream with Mechuiti. Unless they make a successful DC 15 Wisdom saving throw, they are compelled to seek out and join Mechuiti’s cult.\n\n- Water within 1 mile of the lair carries Mechuiti’s Ichor disease. Any creature that drinks the water must make a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw against disease or be infected. An infected creature is poisoned until the disease is cured. Every 24 hours that elapse, the target must repeat the saving throw. On a failure, its hit point maximum is reduced by 5 (2d4). The disease is cured on a success. The target dies if the disease reduces its hit point maximum to 0. This reduction to the target’s hit point maximum lasts until the disease is cured.\n\nwhen Mechuiti dies, all these regional effects fade immediately.\n\n",

Damage done to puppet zombies doesn't affect the mordant snare. If the snare is killed, all of its puppets die immediately without causing any acid damage.\n\n",

If the myling still has the victim grappled at the start of the myling's next turn, both of them disappear into the earth. While buried this way, a creature is considered stunned. It can free itself with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check, but only one check is allowed; if it fails, the creature is powerless to aid itself except with magic. The creature must also make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw; if it succeeds, the creature has a lungful of air and can hold its breath for (Constitution modifier + 1) minutes before suffocation begins. Otherwise, it begins suffocating immediately. Allies equipped with digging tools can reach it in four minutes divided by the number of diggers; someone using an improvised tool (a sword, a plate, bare hands) counts as only one-half of a digger.\n\n",

The touch of a heartstone also cures any disease. Crafting a heartstone takes 30 days.\nSoul Bag: When an evil humanoid dies as a result of a night hag's Nightmare Haunting, the hag catches the soul in this black sack made of stitched flesh. A soul bag can hold only one evil soul at a time, and only the night hag who crafted the bag can catch a soul with it. Crafting a soul bag takes 7 days and a humanoid sacrifice (whose flesh is used to make the bag).\n\nHag Coven: \nWhen hags must work together, they form covens, in spite of their selfish natures. A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of whom are equals within the group. However, each of the hags continues to desire more personal power.\nA coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two hags can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict, the result is usually chaos.\n\nShared Spellcasting (Coven Only): \nWhile all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard's spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves:\n\n• 1st level (4 slots): identify, ray of sickness\n• 2nd level (3 slots): hold person, locate object\n• 3rd level (3 slots): bestow curse, counterspell, lightning bolt\n• 4th level (3 slots): phantasmal killer, polymorph\n• 5th level (2 slots): contact other plane, scrying\n• 6th level (1 slot): eye bite\n\nFor casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save DC is 12+the hag's Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack bonus is 4+the hag's Intelligence modifier.\n\nHag Eye (Coven Only): \nA hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.\nA hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.\n\n",

Her spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 23, +15 to hit with spell attacks). The Queen knows the following sorcerer spells:\n\ncantrips (at will): blade ward, chill touch, dancing lights, mage hand, prestidigitation, ray of frost\n\n1st level (4 slots): mage armor, magic missile, shield\n\n2nd level (3 slots): darkness, mirror image\n\n3rd level (3 slots): blink, fear\n\n4th level (3 slots): confusion, greater invisibility\n\n5th level (3 slots): cone of cold, teleportation circle\n\n6th level (1 slot): circle of death\n\n7th level (1 slot): plane shift, prismatic spray\n\n8th level (1 slot): dominate monster\n\n9th level (1 slot): meteor swarm\n\nThe Queen of Night and Magic's Lair: \non initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the Queen of Night and Magic takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the Queen of Night and Magic can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:\n\n- The Queen wills darkness to overpower the light. All bright light sources in the lair shed only dim light to their normal bright light radius, and dim light sources are extinguished. This lasts until the Queen dismisses the effect or dies.\n\n- An opaque wall of writhing shadows springs up from a solid surface within 120 feet of the Queen. The wall is up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick. Each creature in the area must make a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 18 (4d8) necrotic damage. Creatures in the wall’s space are pushed 5 feet out of the wall’s space, appearing on whichever side of the wall they choose. A creature can move through the wall, but the semimaterial shadow resists intrusion. For every foot a creature travels through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. Furthermore, any creature that, during its own turn, occupies any part of the wall’s space takes 18 (4d8) necrotic damage, or half damage with a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw. Each 10-foot section of wall has AC 5, 15 hit points, vulnerability to radiant damage, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage, and immunity to cold, poison, and psychic damage. The wall lasts until the Queen uses this lair action again, or until she dies.\n\n- The Queen targets one creature within 60 feet of her and assails its mind with visions of hopelessness and despair. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be stunned until initiative count 20 on the next round.\n\nRegional Effects: \nthe region containing the Queen of Night and Magic’s lair is warped by her magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n\n- Shadows come to life within 6 miles of the Queen’s lair. Most of the time these living shadows are unnerving and nothing more, but when a creature acts against the interests of the Queen, the shadows can interfere and cause any relevant die roll to be made with disadvantage.\n\n- Magic saturates the area within 6 miles of the lair, causing minor random effects similar to a prestidigitation cantrip.\n\n- The Queen of Night and Magic can cast her senses to any area containing darkness, dim light, or shadows within 6 miles of her lair, similar to a clairvoyance spell.\n\nwhile the Summer Court rules, the regional effects of the Queen’s lair extend into the Winter Palace, but they are diminished and weaker than normal. During the Winter Court’s reign, the Winter Palace is not subject to the regional effects. If the Queen of Night and Magic dies, conditions in the area surrounding the lair gradually return to normal over the course of 2d10 days.\n\n",

As long as that creature carries the token, it gains the magic resistance trait (see above). Nicnevin can revoke her favor at any time as a bonus action. When that happens, the creature loses the benefit of the token and, if Nicnevin wishes, the creature also has disadvantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects for 24 hours.\n\nThe Queen of Witches's Lair: \non initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Nicnevin takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; Nicnevin can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:\n\n- Nicnevin causes a searing flare of moonlight to burst from a point she can see within 100 feet. All creatures Nicnevin chooses within 30 feet of that point take 13 (3d8) radiant damage, or half damage with a successful DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. Creatures not in their natural form have disadvantage on the saving throw, and if they fail, they revert to their natural form immediately (this does not affect any shape-changing effect created by Nicnevin).\n\n- A wall of softly glowing crystal springs up from a solid surface in the lair. The wall is 60 feet long, 10 feet high, 5 feet thick, blocks line of sight, and sheds dim light out to 10 feet. Creatures within the wall’s area when it appears must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 14 (4d6) radiant damage. The creature is pushed out of the wall’s space to whichever side it chooses. Each 5-foot section of the wall has AC 15, 10 hit points, resistance to fire, slashing, and piercing damage, immunity to poison and psychic damage, and vulnerability to thunder. The wall lasts until Nicnevin uses this action again or dies.\n\n- Until initiative count 20 on the following round, any creatures other than fey who attempt to cast a spell must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or the spell fails and the spell slot is expended. A creature becomes aware of this effect the moment it begins casting a spell, and it can choose to take a different action instead.\n\nRegional Effects: \nthe region containing Nicnevin’s lair is warped by the queen’s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n\n- Calling Nicnevin’s name under the light of the moon within 10 miles of her lair draws Nicnevin’s attention (as if she cast a scrying spell). She may visit the supplicant and hear a request, especially if the request is repeated on multiple nights. For 24 hours after the invocation, Nicenvin has a connection to the area that allows her to target it with teleportation circle.\n\n- Despite the weather, the moon is always visible for most of the night within 10 miles of the lair. Cloud cover has many breaks, or the moon’s light sharply penetrates the clouds.\n\n- Silvery fog is common within 10 miles of the lair, and strange whispers are heard within the mist.\n\nif Nicnevin dies, conditions in the area surrounding the lair return to normal over the course of 1d10 days.\n\n",

Another creature within 5 feet can use an action to make a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check. On a success, the suffocating creature coughs up the water and the effect ends. Otherwise the effect lasts until the River King uses this action again or dies.\n\n- The River King targets a creature he can see within 120 feet. His commanding presence overwhelms the creature, who must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the creature is charmed by the River King until initiative count 20 on the following round.\n\nRegional Effects: \nthe region containing the River King’s lair is warped by its magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n\n- The current of rivers and streams within 6 miles of the lair becomes strong and erratic.

A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the hag is within line of sight, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the hag's Horrific Appearance for the next 24 hours.\nUnless the target is surprised or the revelation of the hag's true form is sudden, the target can avert its eyes and avoid making the initial saving throw. Until the start of its next turn, a creature that averts its eyes has disadvantage on attack rolls against the hag.\n\nHag Coven: \nWhen hags must work together, they form covens, in spite of their selfish natures. A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of whom are equals within the group. However, each of the hags continues to desire more personal power.\nA coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two hags can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict, the result is usually chaos.\n\nShared Spellcasting (Coven Only): \nWhile all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard's spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves:\n\n• 1st level (4 slots): identify, ray of sickness\n• 2nd level (3 slots): hold person, locate object\n• 3rd level (3 slots): bestow curse, counterspell, lightning bolt\n• 4th level (3 slots): phantasmal killer, polymorph\n• 5th level (2 slots): contact other plane, scrying\n• 6th level (1 slot): eye bite\n\nFor casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save DC is 12+the hag's Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack bonus is 4+the hag's Intelligence modifier.\n\nHag Eye (Coven Only): \nA hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.\nA hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.\n\n",

Tosculi from her hive that travel more than 20 miles away instinctively know the direction and distance to the hive and try to return. Hive-queens sometimes dispatch rescue missions to recover separated members of the hive.\n\nHive Queen Lair: \non initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the hive-queen takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:\n\n- The tosculi hive-queen releases a cloud of pheromones that drives the tosculi to fight harder. All tosculi within 60 feet of the hive-queen (including the hive-queen herself) regain 7 (2d6) hit points.\n\n- A swarm of tiny tosculi offspring crawls from its nest and attacks a creature within 120 feet of the hive-queen, automatically doing 10 (4d4) piercing damage. Then the swarm dies. \n\n- The ceiling above one creature that the hive-queen can see within 120 feet of her drips sticky resin. The creature must make a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be encased in rapidly-hardening resin. A creature encased this way is restrained. It can free itself, or another creature within 5 feet can free it, by using an action to make a successful DC 15 Strength check. If the creature is still encased the next time the initiative count reaches 20, the resin hardens, trapping it. The trapped creature can’t move or speak; attack rolls against it have disadvantage because it is encased in resin armor; it automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws; and it has resistance to all damage. The trapped creature is released when the resin is destroyed (AC 10, 20 HP, immune to cold, fire, necrotic, poison, psychic, radiant, and piercing damage). \n\nthe tosculi hive-queen can’t repeat an effect until they have all been used, and she can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row.\n\nRegional Effects: \nthe region containing a tosculi hive-queen’s lair is warped by the creature’s presence, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n\n- Intelligent creatures within 6 miles suffer frequent headaches. It’s as if they had a constant buzzing inside their heads. \n\n- Beasts within 6 miles are more irritable and violent than usual and have the Blood Frenzy trait:The beast has advantage on melee attack rolls against a creature that doesn’t have all its hit points. \n\nif the tosculi hive-queen dies, the buzzing disappears immediately, and the beasts go back to normal within 1d10 days. \n\n",

The ziphius can have only one target swallowed at a time. \n\nIf the ziphius takes 20 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the ziphius must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the swallowed creature, which falls prone in a space within 10 feet of the ziphius. If the ziphius dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 20 feet of movement, exiting prone.\n\nDorsal Fin: \nMelee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
