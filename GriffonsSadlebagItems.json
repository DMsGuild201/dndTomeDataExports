It hovers up to 5 feet above the ground and does its best to stay at your side within your space. The bee can enter and pass through another creature's space and does not provoke opportunity attacks.\n\nThe bee has 8 charges and regains 1d6 + 2 expended charges daily at dawn. While the bee is within your space, you can speak its command word and expend up to 3 of its charges as a bonus action to command the bee to heal a creature that you can see within 20 feet of you. The bee flies to the creature's space and touches its stinger to the creature, emitting a bright light that fills the bee's space and healing the creature for 1d6 hit points for each expended charge. After healing the creature, the bee returns to your space.\n\nThe bee is considered a magical object and is not a creature. It has AC 15, 10 hit points, and has resistance to all damage types. If the mending spell is cast on the bee while it has at least 1 hit point, it regains 2d6 hit points. If the bee drops to 0 hit points, it can't be used again for 24 hours, at which point it regains all its hit points.\n\n\nNo matter the struggle, no matter who won or lost, the Keepers would always be there to pick up the pieces. Their white, lightly armored garb gave them away, as did their beelike companions. Their actions were an altruistic boon to the injured and dying—the only payment they ever requested was a promise that those they helped would, in turn, help others.",

A creature takes 1d6 acid damage when it's restrained by the net and again at the end of each of its turns it remains restrained. If the creature is wearing nonmagical metal armor, its armor is partly corroded and takes a permanent and cumulative −1 penalty to the AC it offers whenever it takes acid damage at the end of one of its turns. The armor is destroyed if the penalty reduces its AC to 10. A creature other than you who touches the net takes 1d6 acid damage.\n\nThe net's sticky composition makes it more difficult to escape than a mundane one. A creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. The net has resistance to all damage types. Dealing 10 slashing damage to the net (AC 12) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and tearing the net apart.\n\nThe torn net is harmless. If more than half of the net can be salvaged and stored within a container large enough to hold 1 gallon of liquid for 12 hours, the net is repaired and can be used once more. Your attunement to the net ends if the net remains destroyed for longer than 2 days.\n\nYou're immune to damage from the net while you're attuned to it. Picking up the net after throwing it renders it harmless until the next time you throw it. The net doesn't deal any acid damage if no creature is attuned to it.\n\n\nThe texture was ooze-like and numbing to the touch. But make no mistake about it: despite the numbing sensation, the sizzle and crackle of boiling flesh was more than enough to know he was in trouble.",

        "item_description": "This magic coral staff was first found within the Great Reef of the Elemental Plane of Water. Its origins beyond that are entirely unknown, with some suggesting it was made by the plane itself rather than forged or crafted by a mere creature's hands. Attuning to the staff bestows some of its planar powers to you, allowing you to breathe underwater and ignore any of the drawbacks caused by a deep, underwater environment. In addition, while holding the staff, you have resistance to cold damage.\n\nThis staff has 15 charges which are used to power its various properties. The staff regains 1d8 + 7 expended charges daily at dawn.\n\nState Change. The staff has a powerful control over the various states of water. As a bonus action, you can mentally command the staff's ever-present bounty of water to change its state into a gas, liquid, or solid. The properties of each state are listed below. Alternatively, you can expend 1 charge as a reaction when you are the target of an attack or spell to force the staff to change its state more rapidly. When you do, the staff's change is immediate: potentially affecting the outcome of the incoming attack or spell. You take this reaction when you know you are the target of the attack or spell, but before knowing the result of the roll.\n\nGas. When the staff enters its gaseous state, the water surrounding the staff becomes a fine mist. While holding the staff in this state, you gain the following properties:\n\n    You are resistant to bludgeoning and piercing damage.\n\n    Your movement speed is increased by 10 feet.\n\n    You gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed.\n\n    You can pass through a hostile creature's space without reducing your movement speed. • Attacks of opportunity against you are made with disadvantage.\n\nGas Spells. While holding the staff in its gas state, you can expend 1 or more of the staff's charges on your turn to cast the following spells from it: cloudkill (5 charges), fog cloud (1 charge), gaseous form (3 charges), misty step (2 charges), or wind walk (6 charges).\n\nTailwind. While holding the staff in its gas state, you can expend 2 charges and speak the staff's command word as an action to grant additional powers to you and nearby allies. Until the end of your next turn, you and friendly creatures of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you can take the Dash action as a bonus action and don't provoke opportunity attacks by moving.\n\nLiquid. When the staff enters its liquid state, the water surrounding the staff becomes a swirling torrent. While holding the staff in this state, you gain the following properties:\n\n    You are resistant to bludgeoning and slashing damage.\n\n    Your movement speed is increased by 10 feet.\n\n    You gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.\n\n    You can stand on and move across any liquid surface as if it were solid ground.\n\n    When a hostile creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to force that creature to repeat the same attack against another creature (other than itself) of your choice.\n\nLiquid Spells. While holding the staff in its liquid state, you can expend 1 or more of the staff's charges on your turn to cast the following spells from it: blur (2 charges), control water (4 charges), create or destroy water (1 charge), mirror image (2 charges), or water breathing (3 charges).\n\nTide Turner. While holding the staff in its liquid state, you can expend 3 charges and speak the staff's command word as an action to send out a wave of ethereal magic water to buffet and push your enemies. Hostile creatures of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you are forced to make a DC 18 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8 bludgeoning damage and is pushed either 20 feet toward you or away from you (your choice). On a successful save, the creature takes half as much bludgeoning damage and is not pushed.\n\nSolid. When the staff enters its solid state, the water surrounding the staff becomes a frozen shell. While holding the staff in this state, you gain the following properties:\n\n    You are resistant to piercing and slashing damage.\n\n    Your movement speed is reduced to 5 feet.\n\n    You gain a +3 bonus to AC.\n\n    If you're pushed against your will, the distance you are pushed is halved.\n\n    You gain 10 temporary hit points at the start of each of your turns that last until the staff changes state.\n\nSolid Spells. While holding the staff in its solid state, you can expend some of the staff's charges on your turn to cast the following spells from it (save DC 18): cone of cold (5 charges), ice storm (4 charges), ray of frost (no charges, or 1 charge to cast at 5th level; +10 to hit with ranged spell attack), wall of ice (6 charges).\n\nDeep Freeze. While holding the staff in its solid state, you can expend 4 charges and speak the staff's command word as an action to send out a chilling blast to freeze your enemies. Hostile creatures of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you are forced to make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8 cold damage and its speed is reduced to 0 until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much cold damage and its speed is halved instead.\n\nRandom Properties. Precipit, the Formless has the following random properties:\n\n    2 minor beneficial properties.\n\n    2 minor detrimental properties.\n\nDestroying the Staff. The only way to destroy the staff is to keep it untouched by water for one hundred years while on the Elemental Plane of Water, at which point it crumbles to dust. Any amount, such as a puff of misty air, a drip of water, or the touch of ice during that time reinvigorates the staff's bounty of water.\n\n\nThe sea is a vessel for life, for time, and for change. How will you live in its watery embrace? Will you be swept up in its currents? And what kind of change is it that you seek to make? The choice is yours.",

While some believe that her ferocity and heroism were a result of phoenix blood running through her veins, others claim that a hero will always rise from the ashes when the time is right.\n\nA spark of this heroism resides within the helmet, imparting its passion and phoenix-like properties to you. You have resistance to fire damage while wearing the helmet. While you're in combat, magical flames spew from the helmet while you wear it. The fire is harmless and casts bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.\n\nFiery Spirit. While wearing the helmet, you and friendly creatures standing within its bright light have advantage on saving throws to resist becoming charmed or frightened. In addition, you and friendly creatures within the bright light regain consciousness on a roll of 19 or 20 on death saving throws.\n\nIgnite. While wearing the helmet, you can cast the fire shield spell to create a warm shield as a bonus action, requiring only verbal components. When you do, you also sprout a pair of flaming wings that last for the duration of the spell and give you a flying speed of 30 feet. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.\n\nCall of the Phoenix. This helm has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 daily at dawn. While wearing the helmet, you can expend 1 or more charges from it to cast the following spells, requiring only verbal components to do so (save DC 18): death ward (3 charges), flame strike (4 charges), or healing word (2nd-level version, 1 charge; +5 spellcasting ability modifier).\n\nFrom the Ashes. If you are reduced to 0 hit points and not killed outright, you can use your reaction to call upon the spark of heroism that resides within the helmet. You are instead reduced to 10 hit points, and each creature within 10 feet of you is forced to make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d10 fire damage, or half as much damage on a successful one. In addition, two flaming wings unfurl from your back and carry you to an unoccupied space up to 60 feet away from you without provoking opportunity attacks. Once this property of the helm has been used, it can't be used again until 2 days have passed. If you die while attuned to this helmet, it vanishes in a cloud of embers and smoke and reappears somewhere in the Elemental Plane of Fire.\n\nRandom Properties. The Galea of the Soulfire Phoenix has the following random properties:\n\n    1 major beneficial property.\n\n    2 minor detrimental properties.\n\n    1 major detrimental property.\n\nDestroying the Helmet. The only way to destroy the helmet is to feed it to an ancient phoenix. The phoenix dies and is immediately reborn as a result of the intense magic stored within the artifact. When it's reborn, the phoenix has a pronounced crown of golden feathers upon its head. Regardless of how many times it's reborn, the phoenix retains this crown of feathers.\n\n\nThe soul of fire was never so brightly manifested in any as it was in Fara. Where she walked, her men had the fortitude and bravery of titans. Where she fought, her foes fell like reeds to a flame. She dealt and staved off death in equal measure, and none would ever be her equal in courage, vivacity, and daring. Long may her memory burn in our hearts and minds, for we are left here to carry on the torch she left for us.",

        "item_description": "This large tree seed is 1 foot long and surrounded in a protective cone. If you're attuned to seed and plant the cone in soil, it takes root and begins to rapidly grow. It takes 1 month for the seed to fully grow. If you are dead for more than 1 minute or are on another plane of existence than the seed for more than 1 day while it grows, the tree dies and the seed is destroyed.\n\nThe stem of the seed's cone is vaguely key-shaped. When planted, the stem breaks off in your hand. While you're attuned to the seed, the stem magically remains on your person at all times.\n\nOnce fully grown, the spire tree is 300 feet tall with a 20-foot radius. It tapers gently inward towards the top of the tree. At the base of this magic tree is a door large enough for Medium creatures to enter. The door is guarded by a dryad who is loyal to you and any creature you choose. The dryad accepts the seed's stem as proof of ownership and uses it as a key to open the door. Once opened, your attunement to the seed ends, the tree belongs to you, and both you and other allies you designate to the dryad can enter and leave the tree at will. Your attunement to the seed does not end if you are more than 100 feet away from it, and can only be ended early by a wish spell. If it does, the key disintegrates and the door cannot be opened.\n\nInside the tree are 10 floors. You choose how to distribute the floors throughout the tree. A wooden spiral staircase climbs upward through the center of the tree and floors. Each floor has 10 small windows that can't be seen from outside the tree. In addition, the interior of the tree can't be the target of divination magic or entered by teleportation or by extradimensional or interplanar means.\n\nThe canopy of the tree extends 30 feet beyond the base of the tree. Soil beneath the tree's canopy is exceptionally rich and fertile.\n\nThe tree has 500 hit points, immunity to damage from nonmagical weapons that aren't siege weapons, and resistance to siege weapons and all other damage. The door has 100 hit points instead. The tree regains 1d6 lost hit points every day after taking damage. If a part of the tree, such as the door, is destroyed, a new one regrows after 7 days.\n\nIf the tree is attacked, it immediately creates a treant at its base to defend it. Roll initiative for the treant, which has its own turns and does its best to defend the tree. Once a treant is created in this way, a new one can't be created until the following dawn. A treant disappears after 24 hours, and there can only be one summoned treant at a time. Neither the treant nor the dryad can move farther than 1 mile from the tree. If the dryad is slain, it reappears the following dawn at the base of the tree. If you kill the dryad, the tree becomes a nonmagical tree that is still hollow inside with the floors you'd chosen, but its windows are lost.\n\nThe tree creates another spire seed once every 100 years.\n\n\n\"Back in the old days, every family had a tree like this. Only when man emerged, and with their merciless greed for land and resources stood at the edges of our homes, did we have to give them up. Now the Spire Trees are few and far between, and protecting them, passing on their seeds only to the trustworthy, is our greatest responsibility.\"- Archdruid Tiren Delduwa.",

Frustrated, he stared at the stick before turning his attention back to the cup in his other hand. He took a deep swig to empty it. Some of the drink dribbled down his mouth and into his beard.\n\n\"Gthinkra shtenickken!\" he shouted once more, and this time made a wild flourish with the stick.

The poured drinks at the bar jostled and rippled, knocking against the polished surface and splattering their contents from side to side.\n\nI held onto the bar, as did the two other men sitting there with me.

The scarf has an extradimensional space within the folds of its fabric that can only be reached while it's worn. The space holds 60 pounds of material, not exceeding a volume of 6 cubic feet. The scarf always weighs 1 pound, regardless of its contents. Placing an object in the scarf follows the normal rules for interacting with objects. When placing an item in the extradimensional space, your hand appears to simply place it inside one of scarf's loose folds.\n\nDespite being able to place items in the scarf, reaching back into it fails to return them to your grasp. The frayed ends of the scarf are actually wisp-like hands that slowly twist and curl on their own. While wearing the scarf, you can mentally command the hands as a bonus action to reach into the extradimensional space and retrieve a stored item. If the scarf is destroyed, its contents are lost forever. Ironing or otherwise flattening the scarf causes the items stored inside to be squeezed out, spilling forth unharmed from the ends of the scarf.\n\nYou can also command the hands as an action to manipulate a simple object, such as open an unlocked door, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial. The hands have a reach of 5 feet. The hands can't attack, activate magic items, or carry more than 10 pounds. The hands hold onto any item retrieved from the scarf weighing no more than 10 pounds until taken from them (no action required). If the retrieved item weighs more than 10 pounds, the hands pull it from the scarf and drop it on the ground at your feet.\n\nA living creature can't be placed inside the scarf.\n\nPlacing the scarf inside an extradimensional space created by a bag of holding, portable hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.\n\n\nSome people get excited when their clothes have pockets. I get excited when they have pocket dimensions.",

Both the spear and its projection have the light property. When you use an action to create a projection in this way, you can make a single weapon attack as part of that action. The projection lasts for 1 minute or until you dismiss it using a bonus action or another creature attempts to hold it. If you drop or stow the crystalline spear, the projection disappears until you hold the spear again.\n\nIf you throw the projection as a ranged attack, the projection disappears after it hits or misses its target. If you're still holding the crystalline spear when this happens, it magically recreates the projection in your open hand again (no action required).\n\nYou gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon and any of its projections. The spear can only have 1 projection active at a time. While it has a projection, the spear and projection each cast bright light out to 5 feet and dim light for another 5 feet.

Once sculpted, a flame retains its form for 1 minute before returning to normal. A nonmagical flame carried in this way burns brightly for 1 hour before dying. If you drop or throw the carried flame, it immediately burns out.\n\nThese gloves have 1 charge that recharges each day at dawn. While wearing the gloves, you can expend 1 charge to cast the continual flame spell without material components, creating the flame in the palm of your hand or allowing it to encompass an entire glove. The flame dies after 1 minute of not being in contact with the glove. In addition, when you take fire damage from a magical source, you can use your reaction to reduce that damage by 1d8 + 2, provided that you have a free hand. If you reduce the damage to 0, you regain 1 charge.\n\n\n\"My light is that of an endless furnace. I will cast out your darkness and set you and your followers alight!\"\n\n\n",

When you hit a creature with a ranged attack using the bow, the bow creates a thin barrier of protective magic that stays between you and that creature until the start of your next turn. If you hit a different creature while protected by the barrier, the barrier moves to defend you against the new target instead. While the barrier is protecting you against a creature in this way, you're considered to have half cover against that creature's ranged attacks and spell effects.\n\n\nHit me with your best shot!",

        "item_description": "This magical shield is made from a piece of reclaimed dragon turtle shell. The brass dragon turtle head sculpture adorning its front magically creates and heats a small reservoir of water that replenishes each day at dawn. When you take fire damage, you can use your reaction to speak the shield's command word to superheat the water inside and halve the fire damage you take from the attack, effect, or spell that triggered it. The superheated water is released as dense cloud of steam centered on a point adjacent to you, heavily obscuring the area in a 20-foot radius sphere that spreads around corners. The cloud does not move with you and lasts for 1 minute or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.\n\nOnce this property of the shield has been used, its reservoir is emptied and can't be used again until the next dawn or it's submerged in nonmagical salt water for at least 1 hour.\n\n\nFear the ocean. Fear the fog. Fear me.\n\n\n",
